1</span> CHAPTER XLIX</h2>
<p>Singular Personage&mdash;A Large Sum&mdash;Papa of
Rome&mdash;We are Christians&mdash;Degenerate
Armenians&mdash;Roots of Ararat&mdash;Regular Features.</p>
<p>The Armenian!&nbsp; I frequently saw this individual, availing
myself of the permission which he had given me to call upon
him.&nbsp; A truly singular personage was he, with his love of
amassing money, and his nationality so strong as to be akin to
poetry.&nbsp; Many an Armenian I have subsequently known fond of
money-getting, and not destitute of national spirit; but never
another who, in the midst of his schemes of lucre, was at all
times willing to enter into a conversation on the structure of
the Haik language, or who ever offered me money to render into
English the fables of Z--- in the hope of astonishing the
stock-jobbers of the Exchange with the wisdom of the Haik
Esop.</p>
<p>But he was fond of money, very fond.&nbsp; Within a little
time I had won his confidence to such a degree that he informed
me that the grand wish of his heart was to be possessed of two
hundred thousand pounds.</p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>&ldquo;I think you might satisfy yourself with the
half,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;One hundred thousand pounds is
a large sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;a
hundred thousand pounds is nothing.&nbsp; My father left me that
or more at his death.&nbsp; No, I shall never be satisfied with
less than two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will you do with your riches,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;when you have obtained them?&nbsp; Will you sit down and
muse upon them, or will you deposit them in a cellar, and go down
once a day to stare at them?&nbsp; I have heard say that the
fulfilment of one&rsquo;s wishes is invariably the precursor of
extreme misery, and forsooth I can scarcely conceive a more
horrible state of existence than to be without a hope or
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bad enough, I dare say,&rdquo; said the Armenian;
&ldquo;it will, however, be time enough to think of disposing of
the money when I have procured it.&nbsp; I still fall short by a
vast sum of the two hundred thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had occasionally much conversation with him on the state and
prospects of his nation, especially of that part of it which
still continued in the original country of the Haiks&mdash;Ararat
and its confines, which, it appeared, he had frequently
visited.&nbsp; He informed me that since the death of the last
Haik monarch, which occurred in the eleventh century, Armenia had
been governed both temporally and spiritually by certain
personages called patriarchs; their temporal authority, however,
was much circumscribed by the Persian and Turk, especially the
former, of whom the Armenian spoke with much hatred, whilst their
spiritual authority had at various times been considerably
undermined <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>by the emissaries of the Papa of Rome,
as the Armenian called him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Papa of Rome sent his emissaries at an early period
amongst us,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;seducing the minds
of weak-headed people, persuading them that the hillocks of Rome
are higher than the ridges of Ararat; that the Roman Papa has
more to say in heaven than the Armenian patriarch, and that puny
Latin is a better language than nervous and sonorous
Haik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are both dialects,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of the
language of Mr. Petulengro, one of whose race I believe to have
been the original founder of Rome; but, with respect to religion,
what are the chief points of your faith? you are Christians, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;we are Christians
in our way; we believe in God, the Holy Spirit, and Saviour,
though we are not prepared to admit that the last Personage is
not only Himself, but the other two.&nbsp; We believe. . .
&rdquo; and then the Armenian told me of several things which the
Haiks believed or disbelieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what we find most
hard of all to believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is that the man of
the mole hills is entitled to our allegiance, he not being a
Haik, or understanding the Haik language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, by your own confession,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he
has introduced a schism in your nation, and has amongst you many
that believe in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;that even
on the confines of Ararat there are a great number who consider
that mountain to be lower than the hillocks of Rome; but the
greater number of degenerate Armenians are to be found amongst
those who have wandered to the West; most of the Haik Churches of
the West consider Rome to be higher <!-- page 4--><a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>than
Ararat&mdash;most of the Armenians of this place hold that dogma;
I, however, have always stood firm in the contrary
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo;&mdash;here the Armenian laughed in his
peculiar manner&mdash;&ldquo;talking of this matter puts me in
mind of an adventure which lately befell me, with one of the
emissaries of the Papa of Rome, for the Papa of Rome has at
present many emissaries in this country, in order to seduce the
people from their own quiet religion to the savage heresy of
Rome; this fellow came to me partly in the hope of converting me,
but principally to extort money for the purpose of furthering the
designs of Rome in this country.&nbsp; I humoured the fellow at
first, keeping him in play for nearly a month, deceiving and
laughing at him.&nbsp; At last he discovered that he could make
nothing of me, and departed with the scowl of Caiaphas, whilst I
cried after him, &lsquo;The roots of Ararat are <i>deeper</i>
than those of Rome.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Armenian had occasionally reverted to the subject of the
translation of the Haik Esop, which he had still a lurking desire
that I should execute; but I had invariably declined the
undertaking, without, however, stating my reasons.&nbsp; On one
occasion, when we had been conversing on the subject, the
Armenian, who had been observing my countenance for some time
with much attention, remarked, &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, you are
right, and you might employ your time to better advantage.&nbsp;
Literature is a fine thing, especially Haik literature, but
neither that nor any other would be likely to serve as a
foundation to a man&rsquo;s fortune: and to make a fortune should
be the principal aim of every one&rsquo;s life; therefore listen
to me.&nbsp; Accept a seat <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>at the desk
opposite to my Moldavian clerk, and receive the rudiments of a
merchant&rsquo;s education.&nbsp; You shall be instructed in the
Armenian way of doing business&mdash;I think you would make an
excellent merchant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have something of the Armenian
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you mean to say
that I squint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;but there
is certainly a kind of irregularity in your features.&nbsp; One
eye appears to me larger than the other&mdash;never mind, but
rather rejoice; in that irregularity consists your
strength.&nbsp; All people with regular features are fools; it is
very hard for them, you&rsquo;ll say, but there is no help: all
we can do, who are not in such a predicament, is to pity those
who are.&nbsp; Well! will you accept my offer?&nbsp; No! you are
a singular individual; but I must not forget my own
concerns.&nbsp; I must now go forth, having an appointment by
which I hope to make money.&rdquo;</p>

6</span>CHAPTER L</h2>
<p>Wish Fulfilled&mdash;Extraordinary
Figure&mdash;Bueno&mdash;Noah&mdash;The Two Faces&mdash;I
Don&rsquo;t Blame Him&mdash;Too Fond of Money&mdash;Were I an
Armenian.</p>
<p>The fulfilment of the Armenian&rsquo;s grand wish was nearer
at hand than either he or I had anticipated.&nbsp; Partly owing
to the success of a bold speculation, in which he had some time
previously engaged, and partly owing to the bequest of a large
sum of money by one of his nation who died at this period in
Paris, he found himself in the possession of a fortune somewhat
exceeding two hundred thousand pounds; this fact he communicated
to me one evening about an hour after the close of &rsquo;Change;
the hour at which I generally called, and at which I mostly found
him at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and what do you intend to
do next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; said the Armenian.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was thinking of that when you came in.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see anything that I can do, save going on in my
former course.&nbsp; After all, I was perhaps too moderate in
making the possession of two hundred thousand pounds the summit
of my ambition; there are many individuals in this town who
possess three <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>times that sum, and are not yet
satisfied.&nbsp; No, I think I can do no better than pursue the
old career; who knows but I may make the two hundred thousand
three or four?&mdash;there is already a surplus, which is an
encouragement; however, we will consider the matter over a goblet
of wine; I have observed of late that you have become partial to
my Cyprus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it came to pass that, as we were seated over the Cyprus
wine, we heard a knock at the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Adelante!&rdquo;
cried the Armenian; whereupon the door opened, and in walked a
somewhat extraordinary figure&mdash;a man in a long loose tunic
of a stuff striped with black and yellow; breeches of plush
velvet, silk stockings, and shoes with silver buckles.&nbsp; On
his head he wore a high-peaked hat; he was tall, had a hooked
nose, and in age was about fifty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Rabbi Manasseh,&rdquo; said the
Armenian.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know your knock&mdash;you are welcome;
sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am welcome,&rdquo; said Manasseh, sitting down;
&ldquo;he! he! he! you know my knock&mdash;I bring you
money&mdash;<i>bueno</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something very peculiar in the sound of that
<i>bueno</i>&mdash;I never forgot it.</p>
<p>Thereupon a conversation ensued between Rabbi Manasseh and the
Armenian, in a language which I knew to be Spanish, though a
peculiar dialect.&nbsp; It related to a mercantile
transaction.&nbsp; The Rabbi sighed heavily as he delivered to
the other a considerable sum of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is right,&rdquo; said the Armenian, handing a
receipt.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is right; and I am quite
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are satisfied&mdash;you have taken money.&nbsp;
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span><i>Bueno</i>, I have nothing to say against your being
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Rabbi,&rdquo; said the Armenian, &ldquo;do not
despond; it may be your turn next to take money; in the meantime,
can&rsquo;t you be persuaded to taste my Cyprus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he! se&ntilde;or, you know I do not love
wine.&nbsp; I love Noah when he is himself; but, as Janus, I love
him not.&nbsp; But you are merry; <i>bueno</i>, you have a right
to be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but does Noah ever
appear as Janus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; said the Rabbi, &ldquo;he only
appeared as Janus once&mdash;una vez quando estuvo borracho;
which means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;when he was . . .
&rdquo; and I drew the side of my right hand sharply across my
left wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you one of our people?&rdquo; said the Rabbi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am one of the Goyim; but I
am only half enlightened.&nbsp; Why should Noah be Janus when he
was in that state?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he! you must know that in Lasan akhades wine is
janin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Armenian, kini,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;in Welsh,
gwin; Latin, vinum; but do you think that Janus and janin are
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I think?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t the commentators say
so?&nbsp; Does not Master Leo Abarbenel say so, in his
&lsquo;Dialogues of Divine Love&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I always thought that Janus
was a god of the ancient Romans, who stood in a temple open in
time of war, and shut in time of peace; he was represented with
two faces, which&mdash;which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; said the Rabbi, rising from his
seat; &ldquo;he had two faces, had he?&nbsp; And what did those
two faces typify?&nbsp; You do not know; no, nor did the Romans
who carved him with two faces know why they did so; for they were
only half enlightened, like you and the rest of the Goyim.&nbsp;
Yet they were right in carving him with two faces looking from
each other&mdash;they were right, though they knew not why; there
was a tradition among them that the Janinoso had two faces, but
they knew not that one was for the world which was gone, and the
other for the world before him&mdash;for the drowned world, and
for the present, as Master Leo Abarbenel says in his
&lsquo;Dialogues of Divine Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; He! he! he!&rdquo;
continued the Rabbi, who had by this time advanced to the door,
and, turning round, waved the two forefingers of his right hand
in our faces; &ldquo;the Goyims and Epicouraiyim are clever men,
they know how to make money better than we of Israel.&nbsp; My
good friend there is a clever man, I bring him money, he never
brought me any; <i>bueno</i>, I do not blame him, he knows much,
very much; but one thing there is my friend does not know, nor
any of the Epicureans, he does not know the sacred thing&mdash;he
has never received the gift of interpretation which God alone
gives to the seed&mdash;he has his gift, I have mine&mdash;he is
satisfied, I don&rsquo;t blame him, <i>bueno</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, with this last word in his mouth, he departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that man a native of Spain?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a native of Spain,&rdquo; said the Armenian,
&ldquo;though he is one of those who call themselves Spanish
Jews, and who are to be found scattered throughout Europe,
speaking the Spanish language <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>transmitted
to them by their ancestors, who were expelled from Spain in the
time of Ferdinand and Isabella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Jews are a singular people,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A race of cowards and dastards,&rdquo; said the
Armenian, &ldquo;without a home or country; servants to servants;
persecuted and despised by all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are the Haiks?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very different from the Jews,&rdquo; replied the
Armenian; &ldquo;the Haiks have a home&mdash;a country, and can
occasionally use a good sword; though it is true they are not
what they might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is a shame that they do not become so,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;but they are too fond of money.&nbsp; There is
yourself, with two hundred thousand pounds in your pocket,
craving for more, whilst you might be turning your wealth to the
service of your country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what manner?&rdquo; said the Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard you say that the grand oppressor of your
country is the Persian; why not attempt to free your country from
his oppression?&mdash;you have two hundred thousand pounds, and
money is the sinew of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, then, have me attack the Persian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know what to say; fighting is a rough trade,
and I am by no means certain that you are calculated for the
scratch.&nbsp; It is not every one who has been brought up in the
school of Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno.&nbsp; All I can say
is, that if I were an Armenian, and had two hundred thousand
pounds to back me, I would attack the Persian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said the Armenian.</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>CHAPTER LI</h2>
<p>The One Half-Crown&mdash;Merit in Patience&mdash;Cementer of
Friendship&mdash;Dreadful Perplexity&mdash;The Usual
Guttural&mdash;Armenian Letters&mdash;Much Indebted to
You&mdash;Pure Helplessness&mdash;Dumb People.</p>
<p>One morning on getting up I discovered that my whole worldly
wealth was reduced to one half-crown&mdash;throughout that day I
walked about in considerable distress of mind; it was now
requisite that I should come to a speedy decision with respect to
what I was to do; I had not many alternatives, and, before I had
retired to rest on the night of the day in question, I had
determined that I could do no better than accept the first
proposal of the Armenian, and translate under his superintendence
the Haik Esop into English.</p>
<p>I reflected, for I made a virtue of necessity, that, after
all, such an employment would be an honest and honourable one;
honest, inasmuch as by engaging in it I should do harm to nobody;
honourable, inasmuch as it was a literary task, which not every
one was capable of executing.&nbsp; It was not every one of the
booksellers&rsquo; writers of London who was competent to
translate the Haik Esop.&nbsp; I determined to accept the offer
of the Armenian.</p>
<p>Once or twice the thought of what I might have <!-- page
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>to
undergo in the translation from certain peculiarities of the
Armenian&rsquo;s temper almost unsettled me; but a mechanical
diving of my hand into my pocket, and the feeling of the solitary
half-crown, confirmed me; after all, this was a life of trial and
tribulation, and I had read somewhere or other that there was
much merit in patience, so I determined to hold fast in my
resolution of accepting the offer of the Armenian.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden I remembered that the Armenian appeared to
have altered his intentions towards me: he appeared no longer
desirous that I should render the Haik Esop into English for the
benefit of the stock-jobbers on Exchange, but rather that I
should acquire the rudiments of doing business in the Armenian
fashion, and accumulate a fortune, which would enable me to make
a figure upon &rsquo;Change with the best of the
stock-jobbers.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought I, withdrawing
my hand from my pocket, whither it had again mechanically dived,
&ldquo;after all, what would the world, what would this city be,
without commerce?&nbsp; I believe the world, and particularly
this city, would cut a very poor figure without commerce; and
then there is something poetical in the idea of doing business
after the Armenian fashion, dealing with dark-faced Lascars and
Rabbins of the Sephardim.&nbsp; Yes, should the Armenian insist
upon it, I will accept a seat at the desk, opposite the Moldavian
clerk.&nbsp; I do not like the idea of cuffs similar to those the
Armenian bestowed upon the Moldavian clerk; whatever merit there
may be in patience, I do not think that my estimation of the
merit of patience would be sufficient to induce me to remain
quietly sitting under the infliction of cuffs.&nbsp; I think <!--
page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>I should, in the event of his cuffing me, knock the
Armenian down.&nbsp; Well, I think I have heard it said
somewhere, that a knock-down blow is a great cementer of
friendship; I think I have heard of two people being better
friends than ever after the one had received from the other a
knock-down blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night I dreamed I had acquired a colossal fortune, some
four hundred thousand pounds, by the Armenian way of doing
business, but suddenly awoke in dreadful perplexity as to how I
should dispose of it.</p>
<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock next morning I set off to the house
of the Armenian; I had never called upon him so early before, and
certainly never with a heart beating with so much eagerness; but
the situation of my affairs had become very critical, and I
thought that I ought to lose no time in informing the Armenian
that I was at length perfectly willing either to translate the
Haik Esop under his superintendence, or to accept a seat at the
desk opposite to the Moldavian clerk, and acquire the secrets of
Armenian commerce.&nbsp; With a quick step I entered the
counting-room, where, notwithstanding the earliness of the hour,
I found the clerk, busied as usual at his desk.</p>
<p>He had always appeared to me a singular being, this same
Moldavian clerk.&nbsp; A person of fewer words could scarcely be
conceived: provided his master were at home, he would, on my
inquiring, nod his head; and, provided he were not, he would
invariably reply with the monosyllable, no, delivered in a
strange guttural tone.&nbsp; On the present occasion, being full
of eagerness and impatience, I was about to pass by him to the
<!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>apartment above, without my usual inquiry, when he
lifted his head from the ledger in which he was writing, and,
laying down his pen, motioned to me with his forefinger, as if to
arrest my progress; whereupon I stopped, and, with a palpitating
heart, demanded whether the master of the house was at
home.&nbsp; The Moldavian clerk replied with his usual guttural,
and, opening his desk, ensconced his head therein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not much matter,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I
suppose I shall find him at home after &rsquo;Change; it does not
much matter, I can return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was turning away with the intention of leaving the room; at
this moment, however, the head of the Moldavian clerk became
visible, and I observed a letter in his hand, which he had
inserted in the desk at the same time with his head; this he
extended towards me, making at the same time a side-long motion
with his head, as much as to say that it contained something
which interested me.</p>
<p>I took the letter, and the Moldavian clerk forthwith resumed
his occupation.&nbsp; The back of the letter bore my name,
written in Armenian characters; with a trembling hand I broke the
seal, and, unfolding the letter, I beheld several lines also
written in the letters of Mesroub, the Cadmus of the
Armenians.</p>
<p>I stared at the lines, and at first could not make out a
syllable of their meaning; at last, however, by continued
staring, I discovered that, though the letters were Armenian, the
words were English; in about ten minutes I had contrived to
decipher the sense of the letter; it ran somewhat in this
style:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear
Friend</span>,&mdash;The words which you uttered in our last
conversation have made a profound impression upon me; I have
thought them over day and night, and have come to the conclusion
that it is my bounden duty to attack the Persians.&nbsp; When
these lines are delivered to you, I shall be on the route to
Ararat.&nbsp; A mercantile speculation will be to the world the
ostensible motive of my journey, and it is singular enough that
one which offers considerable prospect of advantage has just
presented itself on the confines of Persia.&nbsp; Think not,
however, that motives of lucre would have been sufficiently
powerful to tempt me to the East at the present moment.&nbsp; I
may speculate, it is true, but I should scarcely have undertaken
the journey but for your pungent words inciting me to attack the
Persians.&nbsp; Doubt not that I will attack them on the first
opportunity.&nbsp; I thank you heartily for putting me in mind of
my duty.&nbsp; I have hitherto, to use your own words, been too
fond of money-getting, like all my countrymen.&nbsp; I am much
indebted to you; farewell! and may every prosperity await
you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some time after I had deciphered the epistle, I stood as
if rooted to the floor.&nbsp; I felt stunned&mdash;my last hope
was gone; presently a feeling arose in my mind&mdash;a feeling of
self-reproach.&nbsp; Whom had I to blame but myself for the
departure of the Armenian?&nbsp; Would he have ever thought of
attacking the Persians had I not put the idea into his head? he
had told me in his epistle that he was indebted to me for the
idea.&nbsp; But for that, he might at the present moment have
been in London, increasing his fortune by his usual methods, and
I <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>might be commencing under his auspices the translation
of the Haik Esop, with the promise, no doubt, of a considerable
remuneration for my trouble; or I might be taking a seat opposite
the Moldavian clerk, and imbibing the first rudiments of doing
business after the Armenian fashion, with the comfortable hope of
realising, in a short time, a fortune of three or four hundred
thousand pounds; but the Armenian was now gone, and farewell to
the fine hopes I had founded upon him the day before.&nbsp; What
was I to do?&nbsp; I looked wildly around, till my eyes rested on
the Moldavian clerk, who was writing away in his ledger with
particular vehemence.&nbsp; Not knowing well what to do or to
say, I thought I might as well ask the Moldavian clerk when the
Armenian had departed, and when he thought that he would
return.&nbsp; It is true it mattered little to me when he
departed, seeing that he was gone, and it was evident that he
would not be back soon; but I knew not what to do, and in pure
helplessness thought I might as well ask; so I went up to the
Moldavian clerk, and asked him when the Armenian had departed,
and whether he had been gone two days or three?&nbsp; Whereupon
the Moldavian clerk, looking up from his ledger, made certain
signs, which I could by no means understand.&nbsp; I stood
astonished, but, presently recovering myself, inquired when he
considered it probable that the master would return, and whether
he thought it would be two months or&mdash;my tongue
faltered&mdash;two years; whereupon the Moldavian clerk made more
signs than before, and yet more unintelligible; as I persisted,
however, he flung down his pen, and, putting his thumb into his
mouth, moved it rapidly, causing the nail to sound against the
lower jaw; <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>whereupon I saw that he was dumb, and
hurried away, for I had always entertained a horror of dumb
people, having once heard my mother say, when I was a child, that
dumb people were half demoniacs, or little better.</p>

<p>Kind of Stupor&mdash;Peace of God&mdash;Divine
Hand&mdash;Farewell, Child&mdash;The Fair&mdash;Massive
Edifice&mdash;Battered Tars&mdash;Lost! Lost!&mdash;Good Day,
Gentlemen.</p>
<p>Leaving the house of the Armenian, I strolled about for some
time; almost mechanically my feet conducted me to London Bridge,
to the booth in which stood the stall of the old apple-woman; the
sound of her voice aroused me, as I sat in a kind of stupor on
the stone bench beside her; she was inquiring what was the matter
with me.</p>
<p>At first, I believe, I answered her very incoherently, for I
observed alarm beginning to depict itself upon her
countenance.&nbsp; Rousing myself, however, I in my turn put a
few questions to her upon her present condition and
prospects.&nbsp; The old woman&rsquo;s countenance cleared up
instantly; she informed me that she had never been more
comfortable in her life; that her trade, her <i>honest</i>
trade&mdash;laying an emphasis on the word honest&mdash;had
increased of late wonderfully; that her health was better, and,
above all, that she felt no fear and horror &ldquo;here,&rdquo;
laying her hand on her breast.</p>
<p>On my asking her whether she still heard voices in the night,
she told me that she frequently did; <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>but that the
present were mild voices, sweet voices, encouraging voices, very
different from the former ones; that a voice, only the night
previous, had cried out about &ldquo;the peace of God,&rdquo; in
particularly sweet accents; a sentence which she remembered to
have read in her early youth in the primer, but which she had
clean forgotten till the voice the night before brought it to her
recollection.</p>
<p>After a pause, the old woman said to me, &ldquo;I believe,
dear, that it is the blessed book you brought me which has
wrought this goodly change.&nbsp; How glad I am now that I can
read; but oh what a difference between the book you brought to me
and the one you took away.&nbsp; I believe the one you brought is
written by the finger of God, and the other by&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse the book,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is
an excellent book for those who can understand it; it was not
exactly suited to you, and perhaps it had been better that you
had never read it&mdash;and yet, who knows?&nbsp; Peradventure,
if you had not read that book, you would not have been fitted for
the perusal of the one which you say is written by the finger of
God;&rdquo; and, pressing my hand to my head, I fell into a deep
fit of musing.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, after all,&rdquo; thought I,
&ldquo;if there should be more order and system in the working of
the moral world than I have thought?&nbsp; Does there not seem in
the present instance to be something like the working of a Divine
hand?&nbsp; I could not conceive why this woman, better educated
than her mother, should have been, as she certainly was, a worse
character than her mother.&nbsp; Yet perhaps this woman may be
better and happier than her mother ever was; perhaps she is so
already&mdash;perhaps this <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>world is not
a wild, lying dream, as I have occasionally supposed it to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the thought of my own situation did not permit me to
abandon myself much longer to these musings.&nbsp; I started
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you going, child?&rdquo; said the
woman, anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;anywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then stay here,
child,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have much to say to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall be
better moving about;&rdquo; and I was moving away, when it
suddenly occurred to me that I might never see this woman again;
and turning round I offered her my hand, and bade her good
bye.&nbsp; &ldquo;Farewell, child,&rdquo; said the old woman,
&ldquo;and God bless you!&rdquo;&nbsp; I then moved along the
bridge until I reached the Southwark side, and, still holding on
my course, my mind again became quickly abstracted from all
surrounding objects.</p>
<p>At length I found myself in a street or road, with terraces on
either side, and seemingly of interminable length, leading, as it
would appear, to the south-east.&nbsp; I was walking at a great
rate&mdash;there were likewise a great number of people, also
walking at a great rate; also carts and carriages driving at a
great rate; and all&mdash;men, carts, and carriages&mdash;going
in the selfsame direction, namely, to the south-east.&nbsp; I
stopped for a moment and deliberated whether or not I should
proceed.&nbsp; What business had I in that direction?&nbsp; I
could not say that I had any particular business in that
direction, but what could I do were I to turn back? only walk
about well-known streets; and, if I must walk, why not continue
in the direction in which I was to see whither the road and its
terraces led: I was here in a <i>terra incognita</i>, and <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>an unknown place had always some interest for me;
moreover, I had a desire to know whither all this crowd was
going, and for what purpose.&nbsp; I thought they could not be
going far, as crowds seldom go far, especially at such a rate; so
I walked on more lustily than before, passing group after group
of the crowd, and almost vying in speed with some of the
carriages, especially the hackney-coaches; and, by dint of
walking at this rate, the terraces and houses becoming somewhat
less frequent as I advanced, I reached in about three-quarters of
an hour a kind of low dingy town, in the neighbourhood of the
river; the streets were swarming with people, and I concluded,
from the number of wild-beast shows, caravans, gingerbread
stalls, and the like, that a fair was being held.&nbsp; Now, as I
had always been partial to fairs, I felt glad that I had fallen
in with the crowd which had conducted me to the present one, and,
casting away as much as I was able all gloomy thoughts, I did my
best to enter into the diversions of the fair; staring at the
wonderful representations of animals on canvas hung up before the
shows of wild beasts, which, by the bye, are frequently found
much more worthy of admiration than the real beasts themselves;
listening to the jokes of the merry-andrews from the platforms in
front of the temporary theatres, or admiring the splendid tinsel
dresses of the performers who thronged the stages in the
intervals of the entertainments; and in this manner, occasionally
gazing and occasionally listening, I passed through the town till
I came in front of a large edifice looking full upon the majestic
bosom of the Thames.</p>
<p>It was a massive stone edifice, built in an antique <!-- page
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>style, and black with age, with a broad esplanade
between it and the river, on which, mixed with a few people from
the fair, I observed moving about a great many individuals in
quaint dresses of blue, with strange three-cornered hats on their
heads; most of them were mutilated; this had a wooden
leg&mdash;this wanted an arm; some had but one eye; and as I
gazed upon the edifice, and the singular-looking individuals who
moved before it, I guessed where I was.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am at
---,&rdquo; <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> said I; &ldquo;these individuals are
battered tars of Old England, and this edifice, once the
favourite abode of Glorious Elizabeth, is the refuge which a
grateful country has allotted to them.&nbsp; Here they can rest
their weary bodies; at their ease talk over the actions in which
they have been injured; and, with the tear of enthusiasm flowing
from their eyes, boast how they have trod the deck of fame with
Rodney, or Nelson, or others whose names stand emblazoned in the
naval annals of their country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the right, I entered a park or wood consisting of
enormous trees, occupying the foot, sides, and top of a hill
which rose behind the town; there were multitudes of people among
the trees, diverting themselves in various ways.&nbsp; Coming to
the top of the hill, I was presently stopped by a lofty wall,
along which I walked, till, coming to a small gate, I passed
through, and found myself on an extensive green plain, on one
side bounded in part by the wall of the park, and on the others,
in the distance, by extensive ranges of houses; to the south-east
was a lofty eminence, partially clothed with wood.&nbsp; The
plain exhibited an animated scene, a kind of continuation of the
fair below; <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>there were multitudes of people upon
it, many tents, and shows; there was also horse-racing, and much
noise and shouting, the sun shining brightly overhead.&nbsp;
After gazing at the horse-racing for a little time, feeling
myself somewhat tired, I went up to one of the tents, and laid
myself down on the grass.&nbsp; There was much noise in the
tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who will stand me?&rdquo; said a voice with a
slight tendency to lisp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you, my
lord?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said another voice.&nbsp;
Then there was a sound as of a piece of money banging on a
table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lost! lost! lost!&rdquo; cried several
voices; and then the banging down of the money, and the
&ldquo;Lost! lost! lost!&rdquo; were frequently repeated; at last
the second voice exclaimed, &ldquo;I will try no more; you have
cheated me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never cheated any one in my life,
my lord&mdash;all fair&mdash;all chance.&nbsp; Them that finds,
wins&mdash;them that can&rsquo;t finds, loses.&nbsp; Any one else
try?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;ll try?&nbsp; Will you, my lord?&rdquo; and
then it appeared that some other lord tried, for I heard more
money flung down.&nbsp; Then again the cry of &ldquo;Lost!
lost!&rdquo;&mdash;then again the sound of money, and so
on.&nbsp; Once or twice, but not more, I heard &ldquo;Won!
won!&rdquo; but the predominant cry was &ldquo;Lost!
lost!&rdquo;&nbsp; At last there was a considerable hubbub, and
the words &ldquo;Cheat!&rdquo; &ldquo;Rogue!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;You filched away the pea!&rdquo; were used freely by more
voices than one, to which the voice with the tendency to lisp
replied, &ldquo;Never filched a pea in my life; would scorn
it.&nbsp; Always glad when folks wins; but, as those here
don&rsquo;t appear to be civil, nor to wish to play any more, I
shall take myself off with my table; so, good day,
gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Singular Table&mdash;No Money&mdash;Out of Employ&mdash;My

Gentleman&mdash;Not Such Another&mdash;First Edition&mdash;Not

Gorgio&mdash;Alarmed Look.</p>
<p>Presently a man emerged from the tent, bearing before him a
rather singular table; it appeared to be of white deal, was
exceedingly small at the top, and with very long legs.&nbsp; At a
few yards from the entrance he paused, and looked round, as if to
decide on the direction which he should take; presently, his eye
glancing on me as I lay upon the ground, he started, and appeared
for a moment inclined to make off as quick as possible, table and
all.&nbsp; In a moment, however, he seemed to recover assurance,
and, coming up to the place where I was, the long legs of the
table projecting before him, he cried, &ldquo;Glad to see you
here, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fine
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine, my lord; will your lordship play?&nbsp; Them
that finds, wins&mdash;them that don&rsquo;t finds,
loses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play at what?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only at the thimble and pea, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of such a game.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ll soon
teach you,&rdquo; said he, placing the table down.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All you have to do is to put a sovereign down on my table,
and to find the pea, which I put under one of my thimbles.&nbsp;
If you find it,&mdash;and it is easy enough to find it,&mdash;I
give you a sovereign besides your own: for them that finds,
wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And them that don&rsquo;t finds, loses,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;no, I don&rsquo;t wish to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in the first place, I have no money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have no money, that of course alters the
case.&nbsp; If you have no money, you can&rsquo;t play.&nbsp;
Well, I suppose I must be seeing after my customers,&rdquo; said
he, glancing over the plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said the man slowly, but without
moving, and as if in reflection.&nbsp; After a moment or two,
looking at me inquiringly, he added, &ldquo;Out of
employ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;out of employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man measured me with his eye as I lay on the ground.&nbsp;
At length he said, &ldquo;May I speak a word or two to you, my
lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you please,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then just come a little out of hearing, a little
further on the grass, if you please, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me my lord?&rdquo; said I, as I arose
and followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We of the thimble always calls our customers
lords,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t call you
such a foolish name any more; come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man walked along the plain till he came to the side of a
dry pit, when, looking round to see that no one was nigh, he laid
his table on the grass, <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>and, sitting down with his legs over
the side of the pit, he motioned me to do the same.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So you are in want of employ,&rdquo; said he, after I had
sat down beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am very much in want of
employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can find you some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I think you would do
to be my bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonnet!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&nbsp; However, no wonder, as you
had never heard of the thimble and pea game, but I will tell
you.&nbsp; We of the game are very much exposed; folks when they
have lost their money, as those who play with us mostly do,
sometimes uses rough language, calls us cheats, and sometimes
knocks our hats over our eyes; and what&rsquo;s more, with a kick
under our table, cause the top deals to fly off; this is the
third table I have used this day, the other two being broken by
uncivil customers: so we of the game generally like to have
gentlemen go about with us to take our part, and encourage us,
though pretending to know nothing about us; for example, when the
customer says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m cheated,&rsquo; the bonnet must
say, &lsquo;No, you a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, it is all right;&rsquo;
or, when my hat is knocked over my eyes, the bonnet must square,
and say, &lsquo;I never saw the man before in all my life, but I
won&rsquo;t see him ill-used;&rsquo; and so, when they kicks at
the table, the bonnet must say, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t see the
table ill-used, such a nice table, too; besides, I want to play
myself;&rsquo; and then I would say to the bonnet, &lsquo;Thank
you, my lord, them that finds, wins;&rsquo; and then the bonnet
plays, and I lets the bonnet win.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;In a word,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the bonnet means
the man who covers you, even as the real bonnet covers the
head.&rdquo; <a name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I see you are
awake, and would soon make a first-rate bonnet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonnet,&rdquo; said I, musingly; &ldquo;bonnet; it is
metaphorical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;like the cant
words&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bonnet is cant,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;we of the
thimble, as well as all clyfakers and the like, understand cant,
as, of course, must every bonnet; so, if you are employed by me,
you had better learn it as soon as you can, that we may discourse
together without being understood by every one.&nbsp; Besides
covering his principal, a bonnet must have his eyes about him,
for the trade of the pea, though a strictly honest one, is not
altogether lawful; so it is the duty of the bonnet, if he sees
the constable coming, to say, &lsquo;The Gorgio&rsquo;s
welling.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation27b"></a><a
href="#footnote27b" class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not cant,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is the
language of the Rommany Chals.&rdquo; <a
name="citation27c"></a><a href="#footnote27c"
class="citation">[27c]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know those people?&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and their language
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I did,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I would give
ten pounds and more to know the language of the Rommany
Chals.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s some of it in the language of the pea
and thimble; how it came there I don&rsquo;t know, but so it
is.&nbsp; I wish I knew it, but it is difficult.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll make a capital bonnet; shall we close?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would the wages be?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to a first-rate bonnet, as I think you would <!--
page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>prove, I could afford to give from forty to fifty
shillings a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good wages, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-rate,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;bonneting is more
profitable than reviewing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anan?&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or translating; I don&rsquo;t think the Armenian would
have paid me at that rate for translating his Esop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I know what that is, Esop&rsquo;s cant for a
hunchback; but t&rsquo;other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw the man in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and felt him too;
don&rsquo;t you remember the individual from whom you took the
pocket-book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was he?&nbsp; Well, the less said about that
matter the better; I have left off that trade, and taken to this,
which is a much better.&nbsp; Between ourselves, I am not sorry
that I did not carry off that pocket-book; if I had, it might
have encouraged me in the trade, in which, had I remained, I
might have been lagged, sent abroad, as I had been already
imprisoned; so I determined to leave it off at all hazards,
though I was hard up, not having a penny in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wisely resolved,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it was a bad
and dangerous trade; I wonder you should ever have embraced
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very well talking,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;but there is a reason for everything; I am the son of a
Jewess, by a military officer,&rdquo;&mdash;and then the man <!--
page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>told me his story.&nbsp; I shall not repeat the
man&rsquo;s story, it was a poor one, a vile one; at last he
observed, &ldquo;So that affair which you know of determined me
to leave the filching trade, and take up with a more honest and
safe one; so at last I thought of the pea and thimble, but I
wanted funds, especially to pay for lessons at the hands of a
master, for I knew little about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how did you get over that
difficulty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I thought I should
never have got over it.&nbsp; What funds could I raise?&nbsp; I
had nothing to sell; the few clothes I had I wanted, for we of
the thimble must always appear decent, or nobody would come near
us.&nbsp; I was at my wits&rsquo; end; at last I got over my
difficulty in the strangest way in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By an old thing which I had picked up some time
before&mdash;a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A book?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, which I had taken out of your lordship&rsquo;s
pocket one day as you were walking the streets in a great
hurry.&nbsp; I thought it was a pocket-book at first, full of
bank-notes, perhaps,&rdquo; continued he, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was well for me, however, that it was not, for I should
have soon spent the notes; as it was, I had flung the old thing
down with an oath, as soon as I brought it home.&nbsp; When I was
so hard up, however, after the affair with that friend of yours,
I took it up one day, and thought I might make something by it to
support myself a day with.&nbsp; Chance or something else led me
into a grand shop; there was a man there who seemed to be the
master, talking to a jolly, portly old gentleman, who seemed <!--
page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>to be a country squire.&nbsp; Well, I went up to the
first, and offered it for sale; he took the book, opened it at
the title-page, and then all of a sudden his eyes glistened, and
he showed it to the fat, jolly gentleman, and his eyes glistened
too, and I heard him say &lsquo;How singular!&rsquo; and then the
two talked together in a speech I didn&rsquo;t understand&mdash;I
rather thought it was French, at any rate it wasn&rsquo;t cant;
and presently the first asked me what I would take for the
book.&nbsp; Now I am not altogether a fool, nor am I blind, and I
had narrowly marked all that passed, and it came into my head
that now was the time for making a man of myself, at any rate I
could lose nothing by a little confidence; so I looked the man
boldly in the face, and said, &lsquo;I will have five guineas for
that book, there a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t such another in the whole
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said the first man,
&lsquo;there are plenty of them, there have been nearly fifty
editions, to my knowledge; I will give you five
shillings.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not take it, for I don&rsquo;t like to be
cheated, so give me my book again;&rsquo; and I attempted to take
it away from the fat gentleman&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; said the younger man, &lsquo;are you sure
that you won&rsquo;t take less?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Not a
farthing,&rsquo; said I; which was not altogether true, but I
said so.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the fat gentleman,
&lsquo;I will give you what you ask;&rsquo; and sure enough he
presently gave me the money; so I made a bow, and was leaving the
shop, when it came into my head that there was something odd in
all this, and, as I had got the money in my pocket, I turned
back, and, making another bow, said, &lsquo;May I be so bold as
to ask why you gave me all this money for that &rsquo;ere dirty
book?&nbsp; When I came into the shop, I should have been glad to
<!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>get a shilling for it; but I saw you wanted it, and
asked five guineas.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then they looked at one another,
and smiled, and shrugged up their shoulders.&nbsp; Then the first
man, looking at me, said, &lsquo;Friend, you have been a little
too sharp for us; however, we can afford to forgive you, as my
friend here has long been in quest of this particular book; there
are plenty of editions, as I told you, and a common copy is not
worth five shillings; but this is a first edition, and a copy of
the first edition is worth its weight in gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, after all, they outwitted you,&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I might have got
double the price, had I known the value; but I don&rsquo;t care,
much good may it do them, it has done me plenty.&nbsp; By means
of it I have got into an honest, respectable trade, in which
there&rsquo;s little danger and plenty of profit, and got out of
one which would have got me lagged, sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you ought to remember that
the thing was not yours; you took it from me, who had been
requested by a poor old apple-woman to exchange it for a
Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;did she ever get her
Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;she got her
Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she has no cause to complain; and, as for you,
chance or something else has sent you to me, that I may make you
reasonable amends for any loss you may have had.&nbsp; Here am I
ready to make you my bonnet, with forty or fifty shillings a
week, which you say yourself are capital wages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find no fault with the wages,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like the employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like bonneting,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;ah, I
<!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>see, you would like to be principal; well, a time may
come&mdash;those long white fingers of yours would just serve for
the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a difficult one?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is not very easy: two things are
needful&mdash;natural talent, and constant practice; but
I&rsquo;ll show you a point or two connected with the
game;&rdquo; and, placing his table between his knees as he sat
over the side of the pit, he produced three thimbles, and a small
brown pellet, something resembling a pea.&nbsp; He moved the
thimbles and pellet about, now placing it to all appearance under
one, and now under another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Under which is it
now?&rdquo; he said at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Under that,&rdquo; said
I, pointing to the lowermost of the thimbles, which, as they
stood, formed a kind of triangle.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;it is not, but lift it up;&rdquo; and, when I lifted
up the thimble, the pellet, in truth, was not under it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was under none of them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it was
pressed by my little finger against my palm;&rdquo; and then he
showed me how he did the trick, and asked me if the game was not
a funny one; and, on my answering in the affirmative, he said,
&ldquo;I am glad you like it; come along and let us win some
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, getting up, he placed the table before him, and was
moving away; observing, however, that I did not stir, he asked me
what I was staying for.&nbsp; &ldquo;Merely for my own
pleasure,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I like sitting here very
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t close?&rdquo; said
the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;your
proposal does not suit me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may be
principal in time,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;That makes
no difference,&rdquo; said I; and, sitting with my legs over the
pit, I forthwith began to decline an <!-- page 33--><a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Armenian
noun.&nbsp; &ldquo;That a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t cant,&rdquo; said the
man; &ldquo;no, nor Gypsy, either.&nbsp; Well, if you won&rsquo;t
close, another will; I can&rsquo;t lose any more time;&rdquo; and
forthwith he departed.</p>
<p>And after I had declined four Armenian nouns, of different
declensions, I rose from the side of the pit, and wandered about
amongst the various groups of people scattered over the
green.&nbsp; Presently I came to where the man of the thimbles
was standing, with the table before him, and many people about
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them who finds, wins, and them who can&rsquo;t
finds, loses,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; Various individuals tried to
find the pellet, but all were unsuccessful, till at last
considerable dissatisfaction was expressed, and the terms rogue
and cheat were lavished upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never cheated
anybody in all my life,&rdquo; he cried; and, observing me at
hand, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I play fair, my lord?&rdquo; he
inquired.&nbsp; But I made no answer.&nbsp; Presently some more
played, and he permitted one or two to win, and the eagerness to
play with him became greater.&nbsp; After I had looked on for
some time, I was moving away: just then I perceived a short,
thick personage, with a staff in his hand, advancing in a great
hurry; whereupon, with a sudden impulse, I exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Shoon thimble-engro;<br />
Avella Gorgio.&rdquo; <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man, who was in the midst of his pea and thimble process,
no sooner heard the last word of the distich, than he turned an
alarmed look in the direction of where I stood; then, glancing
around, <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and perceiving the constable, he
slipped forthwith his pellet and thimbles into his pocket, and,
lifting up his table, he cried to the people about him,
&ldquo;Make way!&rdquo; and with a motion with his head to me, as
if to follow him, he darted off with a swiftness which the short,
pursy constable could by no means rival; and whither he went, or
what became of him, I know not, inasmuch as I turned away in
another direction.</p>

<p>Mr. Petulengro&mdash;Rommany Rye&mdash;Lil
Writers&mdash;One&rsquo;s Own Horn&mdash;Lawfully earnt
Money&mdash;The Wooded Hill&mdash;A Great Favourite&mdash;The
Shop Window&mdash;Much Wanted.</p>
<p>And, as I wandered along the green, I drew near to a place
where several men, with a cask beside them, sat carousing in the
neighbourhood of a small tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here he comes,&rdquo;
said one of them, as I advanced, and standing up he raised his
voice and sang:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here the Gypsy gemman see,<br />
With his Roman jib and his rome and dree&mdash;<br />
Rome and dree, rum and dry<br />
Rally round the Rommany Rye.&rdquo; <a name="citation35a"></a><a
href="#footnote35a" class="citation">[35a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Mr. Petulengro, who was here diverting himself with
several of his comrades; they all received me with considerable
frankness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit down, brother,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, &ldquo;and take a cup of good ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your health, gentlemen,&rdquo; said
I, as I took the cup which Mr. Petulengro handed to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aukko tu pios <a name="citation35b"></a><a
href="#footnote35b" class="citation">[35b]</a> adrey
Rommanis.&nbsp; Here is your health in Rommany, brother,&rdquo;
said Mr. <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Petulengro; who, having refilled the
cup, now emptied it at a draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your health in Rommany, brother,&rdquo; said Tawno
Chikno, to whom the cup came next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rommany Rye,&rdquo; said a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gypsy gentleman,&rdquo; exclaimed a fourth,
drinking.</p>
<p>And then they all sang in chorus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here the Gypsy gemman see,<br />
With his Roman jib and his rome and dree&mdash;<br />
Rome and dree, rum and dry<br />
Rally round the Rommany Rye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And now, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&ldquo;seeing that you have drunk and been drunken, you will
perhaps tell us where you have been, and what about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in the Big City,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;writing lils.&rdquo; <a name="citation36"></a><a
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;How much money have you got in your pocket,
brother?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteenpence,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;all I have in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in the Big City, too,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro; &ldquo;but I have not written lils&mdash;I have
fought in the ring&mdash;I have fifty pounds in my pocket&mdash;I
have much more in the world.&nbsp; Brother, there is considerable
difference between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather be the lil-writer, after all,&rdquo;
said the tall, handsome, black man; &ldquo;indeed, I would wish
for nothing better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they have so much to say for themselves,&rdquo;
said the black man, &ldquo;even when dead <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>and
gone.&nbsp; When they are laid in the churchyard, it is their own
fault if people a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t talking of them.&nbsp; Who will
know, after I am dead, or bitchadey pawdel, that I was once the
beauty of the world, or that you Jasper were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best man in England of my inches.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s true, Tawno&mdash;however, here&rsquo;s our brother
will perhaps let the world know something about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said the other, with a sigh;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have quite enough to do in writing his own
lils, and telling the world how handsome and clever he was; and
who can blame him?&nbsp; Not I.&nbsp; If I could write lils,
every word should be about myself and my own tacho Rommanis <a
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a>&mdash;my own lawful wedded wife, which
is the same thing.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, I once heard a
wise man say in Brummagem, that &lsquo;there is nothing like
blowing one&rsquo;s own horn,&rsquo; which I conceive to be much
the same thing as writing one&rsquo;s own lil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little more conversation, Mr. Petulengro arose, and
motioned me to follow him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only eighteenpence in the
world, brother!&rdquo; said he, as we walked together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more, I assure you.&nbsp; How came you to ask
me how much money I had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there was something in your look, brother,
something very much resembling that which a person showeth who
does not carry much money in his pocket.&nbsp; I was looking at
my own face this morning in my wife&rsquo;s looking-glass&mdash;I
did not look as you do, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe your sole motive for inquiring,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;was to have an opportunity of venting a foolish <!--
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>boast, and to let me know that you were in possession of
fifty pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of having money unless you let people
know you have it?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
not every one can read faces, brother; and, unless you knew I had
money, how could you ask me to lend you any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to ask you to lend me any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may have it without asking; as I said before,
I have fifty pounds, all lawfully earnt money, got by fighting in
the ring&mdash;I will lend you that, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I will not
take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the half of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor the half of it; but it is getting towards evening,
I must go back to the Great City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will you do in the Boro Foros?&rdquo; <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earn money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look ill, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not feel well; the Great City does not agree with
me.&nbsp; Should I be so fortunate as to earn some money, I would
leave the Big City, and take to the woods and fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may do that, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&ldquo;whether you have money or not.&nbsp; Our tents and horses
are on the other side of yonder wooded hill; come and stay with
us; we shall all be glad of your company, but more especially
myself and my wife Pakomovna.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;What hill is that?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>And then Mr. Petulengro told me the name of the hill.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We shall stay on t&rsquo;other side of the hill a
fortnight,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;and, as you are fond of
lil writing, you may employ yourself profitably whilst
there.&nbsp; You can write the lil of him whose dook <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a> gallops down that hill every night,
even as the living man was wont to do long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jemmy Abershaw,&rdquo; <a name="citation39b"></a><a
href="#footnote39b" class="citation">[39b]</a> said Mr.
Petulengro; &ldquo;one of those whom we call Boro drom engroes,
and the Gorgios highwaymen.&nbsp; I once heard a rye say that the
life of that man would fetch much money; so come to the other
side of the hill, and write the lil in the tent of Jasper and his
wife Pakomovna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first I felt inclined to accept the invitation of Mr.
Petulengro; a little consideration, however, determined me to
decline it.&nbsp; I had always been on excellent terms with Mr.
Petulengro, but I reflected that people might be excellent
friends when they met occasionally in the street, or on the
heath, or in the wood; but that these very people when living
together in a house, to say nothing of a tent, might
quarrel.&nbsp; I reflected, moreover, that Mr. Petulengro had a
wife.&nbsp; I had always, it is true, been a great favourite with
Mrs. Petulengro, who had frequently been loud in her commendation
of the young rye, as she called me, and his turn of conversation;
but this was at a time when I stood in need of nothing, lived
under my parents&rsquo; <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>roof, and only visited at the tents
to divert and to be diverted.&nbsp; The times were altered, and I
was by no means certain that Mrs. Petulengro, when she should
discover that I was in need both of shelter and subsistence,
might not alter her opinion both with respect to the individual
and what he said&mdash;stigmatising my conversation as saucy
discourse, and myself as a scurvy companion; and that she might
bring over her husband to her own way of thinking, provided,
indeed, he should need any conducting.&nbsp; I therefore, though
without declaring my reasons, declined the offer of Mr.
Petulengro, and presently, after shaking him by the hand, bent
again my course towards the Great City.</p>
<p>I crossed the river at a bridge considerably above that hight
of London; for, not being acquainted with the way, I missed the
turning which should have brought me to the latter.&nbsp;
Suddenly I found myself in a street of which I had some
recollection, and mechanically stopped before the window of a
shop at which various publications were exposed; it was that of
the bookseller to whom I had last applied in the hope of selling
my ballads or Ab Gwilym, and who had given me hopes that, in the
event of my writing a decent novel, or a tale, he would prove a
purchaser.&nbsp; As I stood listlessly looking at the window, and
the publications which it contained, I observed a paper affixed
to the glass by wafers with something written upon it.&nbsp; I
drew yet nearer for the purpose of inspecting it; the writing was
in a fair round hand&mdash;&ldquo;A Novel or Tale is much
wanted,&rdquo; was what was written.</p>
<h2><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>CHAPTER LV</h2>
<p>Bread and Water&mdash;Fair Play&mdash;Fashionable
Life&mdash;Colonel B---&mdash;Joseph Sell&mdash;The Kindly
Glow&mdash;Easiest Manner Imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do something,&rdquo; said I, as I sat that night
in my lonely apartment, with some bread and a pitcher of water
before me.</p>
<p>Thereupon taking some of the bread, and eating it, I
considered what I was to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no idea what I
am to do,&rdquo; said I, as I stretched my hand towards the
pitcher, &ldquo;unless&rdquo;&mdash;and here I took a
considerable draught&mdash;&ldquo;I write a tale or a novel . . .
That bookseller,&rdquo; I continued, speaking to myself,
&ldquo;is certainly much in need of a tale or a novel, otherwise
he would not advertise for one.&nbsp; Suppose I write one; I
appear to have no other chance of extricating myself from my
present difficulties; surely it was Fate that conducted me to his
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; said I, as I struck my hand
against the table; &ldquo;I will do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suddenly a
heavy cloud of despondency came over me.&nbsp; Could I do
it?&nbsp; Had I the imagination requisite to write a tale or a
novel?&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said I, as I struck my hand
again against the table, &ldquo;I can manage it; give me fair
play, and I can accomplish anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>But should I have fair play?&nbsp; I must have something
to maintain myself with whilst I wrote my tale, and I had but
eighteenpence in the world.&nbsp; Would that maintain me whilst I
wrote my tale?&nbsp; Yes, I thought it would, provided I ate
bread, which did not cost much, and drank water, which cost
nothing; it was poor diet, it was true, but better men than
myself had written on bread and water; had not the big man told
me so? or something to that effect, months before?</p>
<p>It was true there was my lodging to pay for; but up to the
present time I owed nothing, and perhaps, by the time that the
people of the house asked me for money, I should have written a
tale or a novel, which would bring me in money; I had paper,
pens, and ink, and, let me not forget them, I had candles in my
closet, all paid for, to light me during my night work.&nbsp;
Enough, I would go doggedly to work upon my tale or novel.</p>
<p>But what was the tale or novel to be about?&nbsp; Was it to be
a tale of fashionable life, about Sir Harry Somebody, and the
Countess Something?&nbsp; But I knew nothing about fashionable
people, and cared less; therefore how should I attempt to
describe fashionable life?&nbsp; What should the tale consist
of?&nbsp; The life and adventures of some one.&nbsp;
Good&mdash;but of whom?&nbsp; Did not Mr. Petulengro mention one
Jemmy Abershaw?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Did he not tell me that the life
and adventures of Jemmy Abershaw would bring in much money to the
writer?&nbsp; Yes, but I knew nothing of that worthy.&nbsp; I
heard, it is true, from Mr. Petulengro, that when alive he
committed robberies on the hill on the side of which Mr.
Petulengro had pitched his tents, and that his ghost still
haunted the hill at midnight; <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>but those
were scant materials out of which to write the man&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; It is probable, indeed, that Mr. Petulengro would be
able to supply me with further materials if I should apply to
him, but I was in a hurry, and could not afford the time which it
would be necessary to spend in passing to and from Mr.
Petulengro, and consulting him.&nbsp; Moreover, my pride revolted
at the idea of being beholden to Mr. Petulengro for the materials
of the history.&nbsp; No, I would not write the history of
Abershaw.&nbsp; Whose then&mdash;Harry Simms?&nbsp; Alas, the
life of Harry Simms had been already much better written by
himself than I could hope to do it; and, after all, Harry Simms,
like Jemmy Abershaw, was merely a robber.&nbsp; Both, though bold
and extraordinary men, were merely highwaymen.&nbsp; I questioned
whether I could compose a tale likely to excite any particular
interest out of the exploits of a mere robber.&nbsp; I want a
character for my hero, thought I, something higher than a mere
robber; some one like&mdash;like Colonel B---.&nbsp; By the way,
why should I not write the life and adventures of Colonel B--- of
Londonderry, in Ireland?</p>
<p>A truly singular man was this same Colonel B--- <a
name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a> of Londonderry, in Ireland; a
personage of most strange and incredible feats and daring, who
had been a partisan soldier, a bravo&mdash;who, assisted by
certain discontented troopers, nearly succeeded in stealing the
crown and regalia from the Tower of London; who attempted to hang
the Duke of Ormond, at Tyburn; <a name="citation43b"></a><a
href="#footnote43b" class="citation">[43b]</a> and whose <!--
page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>strange, eventful career did not terminate even with his
life, his dead body, on the circulation of an unfounded report
that he did not come to his death by fair means, having been
exhumed by the mob of his native place, where he had retired to
die, and carried in the coffin through the streets.</p>
<p>Of his life I had inserted an account in the &ldquo;Newgate
Lives and Trials&rdquo;; it was bare and meagre, and written in
the stiff, awkward style of the seventeenth century; it had,
however, strongly captivated my imagination, and I now thought
that out of it something better could be made; that, if I added
to the adventures, and purified the style, I might fashion out of
it a very decent tale or novel.&nbsp; On a sudden, however, the
proverb of mending old garments with new cloth occurred to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;any new
adventures which I can invent will not fadge well with the old
tale; one will but spoil the other.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had better
have nothing to do with Colonel B---, thought I, but boldly and
independently sit down and write the &ldquo;Life of Joseph
Sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Joseph Sell, dear reader, was a fictitious personage who
had just come into my head.&nbsp; I had never even heard of the
name, but just at that moment it happened to come into my head; I
would write an entirely fictitious narrative, called the
&ldquo;Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell, the Great
traveller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had better begin at once, thought I; and removing the bread
and the jug, which latter was now empty, I seized pen and paper,
and forthwith essayed to write the &ldquo;Life of Joseph
Sell,&rdquo; but soon discovered that it is much easier to
resolve upon a thing than to achieve it, or even to commence it;
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>for the life of me I did not know how to begin, and,
after trying in vain to write a line, I thought it would be as
well to go to bed, and defer my projected undertaking till the
morrow.</p>
<p>So I went to bed, but not to sleep.&nbsp; During the greater
part of the night I lay awake, musing upon the work which I had
determined to execute.&nbsp; For a long time my brain was dry and
unproductive; I could form no plan which appeared feasible.&nbsp;
At length I felt within my brain a kindly glow; it was the
commencement of inspiration; in a few minutes I had formed my
plan; I then began to imagine the scenes and the incidents.&nbsp;
Scenes and incidents flitted before my mind&rsquo;s eye so
plentifully, that I knew not how to dispose of them; I was in a
regular embarrassment.&nbsp; At length I got out of the
difficulty in the easiest manner imaginable, namely, by
consigning to the depths of oblivion all the feebler and less
stimulant scenes and incidents, and retaining the better and more
impressive ones.&nbsp; Before morning I had sketched the whole
work on the tablets of my mind, and then resigned myself to sleep
in the pleasing conviction that the most difficult part of my
undertaking was achieved.</p>
<h2><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>CHAPTER LVI</h2>
<p>Considerably Sobered&mdash;Power of Writing&mdash;The
Tempter&mdash;Hungry Talent&mdash;Work Concluded.</p>
<p>Rather late in the morning I awoke; for a few minutes I lay
still, perfectly still; my imagination was considerably sobered;
the scenes and situations which had pleased me so much over night
appeared to me in a far less captivating guise that
morning.&nbsp; I felt languid and almost hopeless&mdash;the
thought, however, of my situation soon roused me&mdash;I must
make an effort to improve the posture of my affairs; there was no
time to be lost; so I sprang out of bed, breakfasted on bread and
water, and then sat down doggedly to write the &ldquo;Life of
Joseph Sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a great thing to have formed my plan, and to have
arranged the scenes in my head, as I had done on the preceding
night.&nbsp; The chief thing requisite at present was the mere
mechanical act of committing them to paper.&nbsp; This I did not
find at first so easy as I could wish&mdash;I wanted mechanical
skill; but I persevered, and before evening I had written ten
pages.&nbsp; I partook of some bread and water; and, before I
went to bed that night, I had completed fifteen pages of my
&ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>The next day I resumed my task&mdash;I found my power of
writing considerably increased; my pen hurried rapidly over the
paper&mdash;my brain was in a wonderfully teeming state; many
scenes and visions which I had not thought of before were
evolved, and, as fast as evolved, written down; they seemed to be
more pat to my purpose, and more natural to my history, than many
others which I had imagined before, and which I made now give
place to these newer creations: by about midnight I had added
thirty fresh pages to my &ldquo;Life and Adventures of Joseph
Sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The third day arose&mdash;it was dark and dreary out of doors,
and I passed it drearily enough within; my brain appeared to have
lost much of its former glow, and my pen much of its power; I,
however, toiled on, but at midnight had only added seven pages to
my history of Joseph Sell.</p>
<p>On the fourth day the sun shone brightly&mdash;I arose, and,
having breakfasted as usual, I fell to work.&nbsp; My brain was
this day wonderfully prolific, and my pen never before or since
glided so rapidly over the paper; towards night I began to feel
strangely about the back part of my head, and my whole system was
extraordinarily affected.&nbsp; I likewise occasionally saw
double&mdash;a tempter now seemed to be at work within me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better leave off now for a short space,&rdquo;
said the tempter, &ldquo;and go out and drink a pint of beer; you
have still one shilling left&mdash;if you go on at this rate, you
will go mad&mdash;go out and spend sixpence, you can afford it,
more than half your work is done.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was about to
obey the suggestion of the tempter, when the idea struck me that,
if I did not complete the work whilst the <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>fit was on
me, I should never complete it; so I held on.&nbsp; I am almost
afraid to state how many pages I wrote that day of the
&ldquo;Life of Joseph Sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time I proceeded in a somewhat more leisurely
manner; but, as I drew nearer and nearer to the completion of my
task, dreadful fears and despondencies came over me&mdash;It will
be too late, thought I; by the time I have finished the work, the
bookseller will have been supplied with a tale or a novel.&nbsp;
Is it probable that, in a town like this, where talent is so
abundant&mdash;hungry talent too, a bookseller can advertise for
a tale or a novel, without being supplied with half a dozen in
twenty-four hours?&nbsp; I may as well fling down my pen&mdash;I
am writing to no purpose.&nbsp; And these thoughts came over my
mind so often, that at last, in utter despair, I flung down the
pen.&nbsp; Whereupon the tempter within me said&mdash;&ldquo;And,
now you have flung down the pen, you may as well fling yourself
out of the window; what remains for you to do?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why
to take it up again, thought I to myself, for I did not like the
latter suggestion at all&mdash;and then forthwith I resumed the
pen, and wrote with greater vigour than before, from about six
o&rsquo;clock in the evening until I could hardly see, when I
rested for a while, when the tempter within me again said, or
appeared to say&mdash;&ldquo;All you have been writing is stuff,
it will never do&mdash;a drug&mdash;a mere drug;&rdquo; and
methought these last words were uttered in the gruff tones of the
big publisher.&nbsp; &ldquo;A thing merely to be sneezed
at,&rdquo; a voice like that of Taggart added; and then I seemed
to hear a sternutation,&mdash;as I probably did, for, recovering
from a kind of swoon, I found myself shivering <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>with
cold.&nbsp; The next day I brought my work to a conclusion.</p>
<p>But the task of revision still remained; for an hour or two I
shrank from it, and remained gazing stupidly at the pile of paper
which I had written over.&nbsp; I was all but exhausted, and I
dreaded, on inspecting the sheets, to find them full of
absurdities which I had paid no regard to in the furor of
composition.&nbsp; But the task, however trying to my nerves,
must be got over; at last, in a kind of desperation, I entered
upon it.&nbsp; It was far from an easy one; there were, however,
fewer errors and absurdities than I had anticipated.&nbsp; About
twelve o&rsquo;clock at night I had got over the task of
revision.&nbsp; &ldquo;To-morrow, for the bookseller,&rdquo; said
I, as my head sank on the pillow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nervous Look&mdash;The Bookseller&rsquo;s Wife&mdash;The Last
Stake&mdash;Terms&mdash;God Forbid!&mdash;Will You Come to
Tea?&mdash;A Light Heart.</p>
<p>On arriving at the bookseller&rsquo;s shop, I cast a nervous
look at the window, for the purpose of observing whether the
paper had been removed or not.&nbsp; To my great delight the
paper was in its place; with a beating heart I entered, there was
nobody in the shop; as I stood at the counter, however,
deliberating whether or not I should call out, the door of what
seemed to be a back-parlour opened and out came a well dressed
lady-like female, of about thirty, with a good-looking and
intelligent countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is your business,
young man?&rdquo; said she to me, after I had made her a polite
bow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish to speak to the gentleman of the
house,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;My husband is not within at
present,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;what is your
business?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have merely brought something to
show him,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I will call
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you are the young gentleman who has
been here before,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;with poems and
ballads, as, indeed, I know you are,&rdquo; she added, smiling,
&ldquo;for I have seen you through the glass door, I am afraid it
will be useless; that is,&rdquo; she added, with another smile,
&ldquo;if you bring us nothing <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>else.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not brought you poems
and ballads now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but something widely
different; I saw your advertisement for a tale or a novel, and
have written something which I think will suit; and here it
is,&rdquo; I added, showing the roll of paper which I held in my
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the bookseller&rsquo;s wife,
&ldquo;you may leave it, though I cannot promise you much chance
of its being accepted.&nbsp; My husband has already had several
offered to him; however, you may leave it; give it me.&nbsp; Are
you afraid to entrust it to me?&rdquo; she demanded somewhat
hastily, observing that I hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse
me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but it is all I have to depend upon in
the world; I am chiefly apprehensive that it will not be
read.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;On that point I can reassure
you,&rdquo; said the good lady, smiling, and there was now
something sweet in her smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;I give you my word
that it shall be read; come again to-morrow morning at eleven,
when, if not approved, it shall be returned to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned to my lodging, and forthwith betook myself to bed,
notwithstanding the earliness of the hour.&nbsp; I felt tolerably
tranquil; I had now cast my last stake, and was prepared to abide
by the result.&nbsp; Whatever that result might be, I could have
nothing to reproach myself with; I had strained all the energies
which nature had given me in order to rescue myself from the
difficulties which surrounded me.&nbsp; I presently sank into a
sleep, which endured during the remainder of the day, and the
whole of the succeeding night.&nbsp; I awoke about nine on the
morrow, and spent my last threepence on a breakfast somewhat more
luxurious than the immediately preceding ones, <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>for one penny
of the sum was expended on the purchase of milk.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour I repaired to the house of the
bookseller; the bookseller was in his shop.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, as soon as I entered, &ldquo;I am glad
to see you.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was an unwonted heartiness in the
bookseller&rsquo;s tones, an unwonted benignity in his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said he, after a pause, &ldquo;you
have taken my advice, written a book of adventure; nothing like
taking the advice, young man, of your superiors in age.&nbsp;
Well, I think your book will do, and so does my wife, for whose
judgment I have a great regard; as well I may, as she is the
daughter of a first-rate novelist, deceased.&nbsp; I think I
shall venture on sending your book to the press.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we have not yet agreed upon
terms.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Terms, terms,&rdquo; said the
bookseller; &ldquo;ahem! well, there is nothing like coming to
terms at once.&nbsp; I will print the book, and give you half the
profit when the edition is sold.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will
not do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I intend shortly to leave London: I
must have something at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, I
see,&rdquo; said the bookseller, &ldquo;in distress; frequently
the case with authors, especially young ones.&nbsp; Well, I
don&rsquo;t care if I purchase it of you, but you must be
moderate; the public are very fastidious, and the speculation may
prove a losing one after all.&nbsp; Let me see, will five . . .
hem&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped.&nbsp; I looked the bookseller in the
face; there was something peculiar in it.&nbsp; Suddenly it
appeared to me as if the voice of him of the thimble sounded in
my ear, &ldquo;Now is your time, ask enough, never such another
chance of establishing yourself; respectable trade, pea and
thimble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I at last,
&ldquo;I have no objection to <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>take the
offer which you were about to make, though I really think
five-and-twenty guineas to be scarcely enough, everything
considered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Five-and-twenty guineas!&rdquo;
said the bookseller; &ldquo;are you&mdash;what was I going to
say&mdash;I never meant to offer half as much&mdash;I mean a
quarter; I was going to say five guineas&mdash;I mean pounds; I
will, however, make it guineas.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That will not
do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but, as I find we shall not deal,
return me my manuscript, that I may carry it to some one
else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bookseller looked blank.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear
me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should never have supposed that you
would have made any objection to such an offer; I am quite sure
that you would have been glad to take five pounds for either of
the two huge manuscripts of songs and ballads that you brought me
on a former occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;if you will engage to publish either of those two
manuscripts, you shall have the present one for five
pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;God forbid that I should make any
such bargain,&rdquo; said the bookseller; &ldquo;I would publish
neither on any account; but, with respect to this last book, I
have really an inclination to print it, both for your sake and
mine; suppose we say ten pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;ten pounds will not do; pray restore me my
manuscript.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said the bookseller,
&ldquo;my wife is in the next room, I will go and consult
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he went into his back room, where I
heard him conversing with his wife in a low tone; in about ten
minutes he returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young gentleman,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;perhaps you will take tea with us this evening, when
we will talk further over the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening I went and took tea with the <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>bookseller
and his wife, both of whom, particularly the latter, overwhelmed
me with civility.&nbsp; It was not long before I learned that the
work had been already sent to the press, and was intended to
stand at the head of a series of entertaining narratives, from
which my friends promised themselves considerable profit.&nbsp;
The subject of terms was again brought forward.&nbsp; I stood
firm to my first demand for a long time; when, however, the
bookseller&rsquo;s wife complimented me on my production in the
highest terms, and said that she discovered therein the germs of
genius, which she made no doubt would some day prove ornamental
to my native land, I consented to drop my demand to twenty
pounds, stipulating, however, that I should not be troubled with
the correction of the work.</p>
<p>Before I departed, I received the twenty pounds, and departed
with a light heart to my lodgings.</p>

<p>Indisposition&mdash;A Resolution&mdash;Poor
Equivalents&mdash;The Piece of Gold&mdash;Flashing Eyes&mdash;How
Beautiful!&mdash;Bon Jour, Monsieur.</p>
<p>I had long ago determined to leave London as soon as the means
should be in my power, and, now that they were, I determined to
leave the Great City; yet I felt some reluctance to go.&nbsp; I
would fain have pursued the career of original authorship which
had just opened itself to me, and have written other tales of
adventure.&nbsp; The bookseller had given me encouragement enough
to do so; he had assured me that he should be always happy to
deal with me for an article (that was the word) similar to the
one I had brought him, provided my terms were moderate; and the
bookseller&rsquo;s wife, by her complimentary language, had given
me yet more encouragement.&nbsp; But for some months past I had
been far from well, and my original indisposition, brought on
partly by the peculiar atmosphere of the Big City, partly by
anxiety of mind, had been much increased by the exertions which I
had been compelled to make during the last few days.&nbsp; I felt
that, were I to remain where I was, I should die, or become a
confirmed valetudinarian.&nbsp; I would go forth into the
country, travelling on foot, and, by exercise <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>and inhaling
pure air, endeavour to recover my health, leaving my subsequent
movements to be determined by Providence.</p>
<p>But whither should I bend my course?&nbsp; Once or twice I
thought of walking home to the old town, stay some time with my
mother and my brother, and enjoy the pleasant walks in the
neighbourhood; but, though I wished very much to see my mother
and my brother, and felt much disposed to enjoy the said pleasant
walks, the old town was not exactly the place to which I wished
to go at this present juncture.&nbsp; I was afraid that people
would ask, Where are your Northern Ballads?&nbsp; Where are your
alliterative translations from Ab Gwilym&mdash;of which you were
always talking, and with which you promised to astonish the
world?&nbsp; Now, in the event of such interrogations, what could
I answer?&nbsp; It is true I had compiled Newgate Lives and
Trials, and had written the life of Joseph Sell, but I was afraid
that the people of the old town would scarcely consider these as
equivalents for the Northern Ballads and the songs of Ab
Gwilym.&nbsp; I would go forth and wander in any direction but
that of the old town.</p>
<p>But how one&rsquo;s sensibility on any particular point
diminishes with time; at present I enter the old town perfectly
indifferent as to what the people may be thinking on the subject
of the songs and ballads.&nbsp; With respect to the people
themselves, whether, like my sensibility, their curiosity has
altogether evaporated, or whether, which is at least equally
probable, they never entertained any, one thing is certain, that
never in a single instance have they troubled me with any remarks
on the subject of the songs and ballads.</p>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>As it was my intention to travel on foot, with a bundle
and a stick, I despatched my trunk containing some few clothes
and books to the old town.&nbsp; My preparations were soon made;
in about three days I was in readiness to start.</p>
<p>Before departing, however, I bethought me of my old friend the
apple-woman of London Bridge.&nbsp; Apprehensive that she might
be labouring under the difficulties of poverty, I sent her a
piece of gold by the hands of a young maiden in the house in
which I lived.&nbsp; The latter punctually executed her
commission, but brought me back the piece of gold.&nbsp; The old
woman would not take it; she did not want it, she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell the poor thin lad,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;to keep
it for himself, he wants it more than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather late one afternoon I departed from my lodging, with my
stick in one hand and a small bundle in the other, shaping my
course to the south-west: when I first arrived, somewhat more
than a year before, I had entered the city by the
north-east.&nbsp; As I was not going home, I determined to take
my departure in the direction the very opposite to home.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to cross the street called the Haymarket,
at the lower part, a cabriolet, drawn by a magnificent animal,
came dashing along at a furious rate; it stopped close by the
curb-stone where I was, a sudden pull of the reins nearly
bringing the spirited animal upon its haunches.&nbsp; The Jehu
who had accomplished this feat was Francis Ardry.&nbsp; A small
beautiful female, with flashing eyes, dressed in the extremity of
fashion, sat beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holloa, friend,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry,
&ldquo;whither bound?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;all I can
say, is, that I am about to leave London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the means?&rdquo; said Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have them,&rdquo; said I, with a cheerful smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qui est celui-ci</i>?&rdquo; demanded the small
female, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est . . . mon ami le plus intime</i>; so you
were about to leave London without telling me a word,&rdquo; said
Francis Ardry, somewhat angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intended to have written to you,&rdquo; said I:
&ldquo;what a splendid mare that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she not?&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, who was holding
in the mare with difficulty; &ldquo;she cost a hundred
guineas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;est-ce qu&rsquo;il dit</i>?&rdquo; demanded
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Il dit que le jument est bien beau</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Allons</i>, <i>mon ami</i>, <i>il est
tard</i>,&rdquo; said the beauty, with a scornful toss of her
head; &ldquo;<i>allons</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Encore un moment</i>,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry;
&ldquo;and when shall I see you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;I never saw a
more splendid turn-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Qu&rsquo;est-ce qu&rsquo;il dit</i>?&rdquo; said the
lady again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Il dit que tout l&rsquo;&eacute;quipage est en assez
bon go&ucirc;t</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Allons</i>, <i>c&rsquo;est un ours</i>,&rdquo; said
the lady; &ldquo;<i>le cheval m&ecirc;me en a peur</i>,&rdquo;
added she, as the mare reared up on high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you find nothing else to admire but the mare and
the equipage?&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, reproachfully, after he
had with some difficulty brought the mare to order.</p>
<p>Lifting my hand, in which I held my stick, I took off my
hat.&nbsp; &ldquo;How beautiful!&rdquo; said I, looking the lady
full in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Comment</i>?&rdquo; said the lady, inquiringly.</p>
<p><!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;<i>Il dit que vous &ecirc;tes belle comme un
ange</i>,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais</i>, <i>&agrave; la bonne heure!
arr&ecirc;tez</i>, <i>mon ami</i>,&rdquo; said the lady to
Francis Ardry, who was about to drive off; &ldquo;<i>je voudrais
bien causer un moment avec lui</i>; <i>arr&ecirc;tez</i>, <i>il
est d&eacute;licieux</i>.&mdash;<i>Est-ce bien ainsi que vous
traitez vos amis</i>?&rdquo; said she, passionately, as Francis
Ardry lifted up his whip.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Bon jour</i>,
<i>Monsieur</i>, <i>bon jour</i>,&rdquo; said she, thrusting her
head from the side and looking back, as Francis Ardry drove off
at the rate of thirteen miles an hour.</p>

60</span>CHAPTER LIX</h2>
<p>The Milestone&mdash;The Meditation&mdash;Want to Get
Up?&mdash;The Off-hand Leader&mdash;Sixteen Shillings&mdash;The
Near-hand Wheeler&mdash;All Right.</p>
<p>In about two hours I had cleared the Great City, and got
beyond the suburban villages, or rather towns, in the direction
in which I was travelling; I was in a broad and excellent road,
leading I knew not whither.&nbsp; I now slackened my pace, which
had hitherto been great.&nbsp; Presently, coming to a milestone
on which was graven nine miles, I rested against it, and looking
round towards the vast city, which had long ceased to be visible,
I fell into a train of meditation.</p>
<p>I thought of all my ways and doings since the day of my first
arrival in that vast city&mdash;I had worked and toiled, and,
though I had accomplished nothing at all commensurate with the
hopes which I had entertained previous to my arrival, I had
achieved my own living, preserved my independence, and become
indebted to no one.&nbsp; I was now quitting it, poor in purse,
it is true, but not wholly empty; rather ailing it may be, but
not broken in health; and, with hope within my bosom, had I not
cause upon the whole to be thankful?&nbsp; Perhaps there were
some who, arriving at the same time under not more favourable
circumstances, had <!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>accomplished much more, and whose
future was far more hopeful&mdash;Good!&nbsp; But there might be
others who, in spite of all their efforts, had been either
trodden down in the press, never more to be heard of, or were
quitting that mighty town broken in purse, broken in health, and,
oh! with not one dear hope to cheer them.&nbsp; Had I not, upon
the whole, abundant cause to be grateful?&nbsp; Truly, yes!</p>
<p>My meditation over, I left the milestone and proceeded on my
way in the same direction as before until the night began to
close in.&nbsp; I had always been a good pedestrian; but now,
whether owing to indisposition or to not having for some time
past been much in the habit of taking such lengthy walks, I began
to feel not a little weary.&nbsp; Just as I was thinking of
putting up for the night at the next inn or public-house I should
arrive at, I heard what sounded like a coach coming up rapidly
behind me.&nbsp; Induced, perhaps, by the weariness which I felt,
I stopped and looked wistfully in the direction of the sound;
presently up came a coach, seemingly a mail, drawn by four
bounding horses&mdash;there was no one upon it but the coachman
and the guard; when nearly parallel with me it stopped.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Want to get up?&rdquo; sounded a voice, in the true
coachman-like tone&mdash;half querulous, half
authoritative.&nbsp; I hesitated; I was tired, it is true, but I
had left London bound on a pedestrian excursion, and I did not
much like the idea of having recourse to a coach after
accomplishing so very inconsiderable a distance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, we can&rsquo;t be staying here all night,&rdquo;
said the voice, more sharply than before.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can ride
a little way, and get down whenever I like,&rdquo; thought I;
<!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>and springing forward I clambered up the coach, and was
going to sit down upon the box, next the coachman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the coachman, who was a man about
thirty, with a hooked nose and red face, dressed in a fashionably
cut great-coat, with a fashionable black castor on his
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, keep behind&mdash;the box
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t for the like of you,&rdquo; said he, as he
drove off; &ldquo;the box is for lords, or gentlemen at
least.&rdquo;&nbsp; I made no answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;D--- that
off-hand leader,&rdquo; said the coachman, as the right-hand
front horse made a desperate start at something he saw in the
road; and, half rising, he with great dexterity hit with his long
whip the off-hand leader a cut on the off cheek.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These seem to be fine horses,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; The
coachman made no answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nearly thoroughbred,&rdquo;
I continued; the coachman drew his breath, with a kind of hissing
sound, through his teeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, young fellow, none
of your chaff.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think, because you ride on
my mail, I&rsquo;m going to talk to you about &rsquo;orses.&nbsp;
I talk to nobody about &rsquo;orses except lords.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have been called a lord in
my time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It must have been by a
thimble-rigger, then,&rdquo; said the coachman, bending back, and
half turning his face round with a broad leer.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have hit the mark wonderfully,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
coachmen, whatever else you may be, are certainly no
fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t,
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; said the coachman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There you are right; and, to show you that you are,
I&rsquo;ll now trouble you for your fare.&nbsp; If you have been
amongst the thimble-riggers you must be tolerably well cleared
out.&nbsp; Where are you going?&mdash;to ---?&nbsp; I think I
have seen you there.&nbsp; The fare is sixteen shillings.&nbsp;
Come, tip us the blunt; <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>them that has no money can&rsquo;t
ride on my mail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sixteen shillings was a large sum, and to pay it would make a
considerable inroad on my slender finances; I thought, at first,
that I would say I did not want to go so far; but then the fellow
would ask at once where I wanted to go, and I was ashamed to
acknowledge my utter ignorance of the road.&nbsp; I determined,
therefore, to pay the fare, with a tacit determination not to
mount a coach in future without knowing whither I was
going.&nbsp; So I paid the man the money, who, turning round,
shouted to the guard&mdash;&ldquo;All right, Jem; got fare to
---;&rdquo; <a name="citation63"></a><a href="#footnote63"
class="citation">[63]</a> and forthwith whipped on his horses,
especially the off-hand leader, for whom he seemed to entertain a
particular spite, to greater speed than before&mdash;the horses
flew.</p>
<p>A young moon gave a feeble light, partially illuminating a
line of road which, appearing by no means interesting, I the less
regretted having paid my money for the privilege of being hurried
along it in the flying vehicle.&nbsp; We frequently changed
horses; and at last my friend the coachman was replaced by
another, the very image of himself&mdash;hawk nose, red face,
with narrow-rimmed hat and fashionable benjamin.&nbsp; After he
had driven about fifty yards, the new coachman fell to whipping
one of the horses.&nbsp; &ldquo;D--- this near-hand
wheeler,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the brute has got a
corn.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Whipping him won&rsquo;t cure him of
his corn,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who told you to
speak?&rdquo; said the driver, with an oath; &ldquo;mind your own
business; &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t from the like of you I am to learn
to drive &rsquo;orses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Presently I fell into a
broken kind of slumber.&nbsp; In <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>an hour or
two I was aroused by a rough voice&mdash;&ldquo;Got to ---, young
man; get down if you please.&rdquo;&nbsp; I opened my
eyes&mdash;there was a dim and indistinct light, like that which
precedes dawn; the coach was standing still in something like a
street; just below me stood the guard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean
to get down,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or will you keep us here till
morning? other fares want to get up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely
knowing what I did, I took my bundle and stick and descended,
whilst two people mounted.&nbsp; &ldquo;All right, John,&rdquo;
said the guard to the coachman, springing up behind; whereupon
off whisked the coach, one or two individuals who were standing
by disappeared, and I was left alone.</p>

Circle&mdash;The Shepherd&mdash;Heaps and Barrows&mdash;What do
you Mean?&mdash;Milk of the Plains&mdash;Hengist Spared
it&mdash;No Presents.</p>
<p>After standing still a minute or two, considering what I
should do, I moved down what appeared to be the street of a small
straggling town; presently I passed by a church, which rose
indistinctly on my right hand; anon there was the rustling of
foliage and the rushing of waters.&nbsp; I reached a bridge,
beneath which a small stream <a name="citation65"></a><a
href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a> was running in the
direction of the south.&nbsp; I stopped and leaned over the
parapet, for I have always loved to look upon streams, especially
at the still hours.&nbsp; &ldquo;What stream is this, I
wonder?&rdquo; said I, as I looked down from the parapet into the
water, which whirled and gurgled below.</p>
<p>Leaving the bridge, I ascended a gentle acclivity, and
presently reached what appeared to be a tract of moory undulating
ground.&nbsp; It was now tolerably light, but there was a mist or
haze abroad which prevented my seeing objects with much
precision.&nbsp; I felt chill in the damp air of the early morn,
and <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>walked rapidly forward.&nbsp; In about half an hour I
arrived where the road divided into two, at an angle or tongue of
dark green sward.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the right or the left?&rdquo;
said I, and forthwith took, without knowing why, the left-hand
road, along which I proceeded about a hundred yards, when, in the
midst of the tongue of sward formed by the two roads,
collaterally with myself, I perceived what I at first conceived
to be a small grove of blighted trunks of oaks, barked and
grey.&nbsp; I stood still for a moment, and then, turning off the
road, advanced slowly towards it over the sward; as I drew
nearer, I perceived that the objects which had attracted my
curiosity, and which formed a kind of circle, were not trees, but
immense upright stones.&nbsp; A thrill pervaded my system; just
before me were two, the mightiest of the whole, tall as the stems
of proud oaks, supporting on their tops a huge transverse stone,
and forming a wonderful doorway.&nbsp; I knew now where I was,
and, laying down my stick and bundle, and taking off my hat, I
advanced slowly, and cast myself&mdash;it was folly, perhaps, but
I could not help what I did&mdash;cast myself, with my face on
the dewy earth, in the middle of the portal of giants, beneath
the transverse stone.</p>
<p>The spirit of Stonehenge was strong upon me!</p>
<p>And after I had remained with my face on the ground for some
time, I arose, placed my hat on my head, and, taking up my stick
and bundle, wandered round the wondrous circle, examining each
individual stone, from the greatest to the least; and then,
entering by the great door, seated myself upon an immense broad
stone, one side of which was supported by several small ones, and
the <!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>other slanted upon the earth; and there, in deep
meditation, I sat for an hour or two, till the sun shone in my
face above the tall stones of the eastern side.</p>
<p>And as I still sat there, I heard the noise of bells, and
presently a large number of sheep came browsing past the circle
of stones; two or three entered, and grazed upon what they could
find, and soon a man also entered the circle at the northern
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early here, sir,&rdquo; said the man, who was tall, and
dressed in a dark green slop, and had all the appearance of a
shepherd; &ldquo;a traveller, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am a traveller.&nbsp; Are
these sheep yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, sir; that is, they are my
master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A strange place this, sir,&rdquo; said he,
looking at the stones; &ldquo;ever here before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never in body, frequently in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard of the stones, I suppose; no wonder&mdash;all the
people of the plain talk of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the people of the plain say of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they say&mdash;How did they ever come
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they not suppose them to have been
brought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who should have brought them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read that they were brought by many thousand
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they bring them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did they bring them for?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;To form a temple, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A place to worship God in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange place to worship God in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has no roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes it has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said the man, looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see above you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did these stones come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there other stones like these on the plains?&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None; and yet there are plenty of strange things on
these downs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange heaps, and barrows, and great walls of earth
built on the tops of hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the people of the plain wonder how they came
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were raised by hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they ever come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether they are here?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These stones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So sure as the world,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;and,
as the world, they will stand as long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether there is a world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&ldquo;An earth, and sea, moon and stars, sheep and
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard it doubted before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible there should be a world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t possible there shouldn&rsquo;t be
a world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this moment a fine ewe,
attended by a lamb, rushed into the circle and fondled the knees
of the shepherd.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you would not care to
have some milk,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, so be, there be no sheep, no milk, you know;
and what there ben&rsquo;t is not worth having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not have argued better,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;that is, supposing you have argued; with respect to the
milk you may do as you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still, Nanny,&rdquo; said the man; and producing a
tin vessel from his scrip, he milked the ewe into it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here is milk of the plains, master,&rdquo; said the man,
as he handed the vessel to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are those barrows and great walls of earth you
were speaking of?&rdquo; said I, after I had drank some of the
milk; &ldquo;are there any near where we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not within many miles; the nearest is yonder
away,&rdquo; said the shepherd, pointing to the south-east.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a grand place, that, but not like this; quite
different, and from it you have a sight of the finest spire in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to it,&rdquo; said I, and I drank the
remainder of the milk; &ldquo;yonder, you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;Yes, yonder; but you cannot get to it in that
direction, the river lies between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avon is British,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;we are all British
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are not,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were the British?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men who are supposed to have worshipped God in this
place, and who raised these stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our forefathers slaughtered them, spilled their blood
all about, especially in this neighbourhood, destroyed their
pleasant places, and left not, to use their own words, one stone
upon another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they did,&rdquo; said the shepherd, looking aloft
at the transverse stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is well for them they did; whenever that stone,
which English hands never raised, is by English hands thrown
down, woe, woe, woe to the English race; spare it, English!&nbsp;
Hengist spared it!&mdash;Here is sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk so prettily about these stones; you seem to
know all about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never receive presents; with respect to the stones, I
say with yourself, How did they ever come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they ever come here?&rdquo; said the
shepherd.</p>

<p>The River&mdash;Arid Downs&mdash;A Prospect.</p>
<p>Leaving the shepherd, I bent my way in the direction pointed
out by him as that in which the most remarkable of the strange
remains of which he had spoken lay.&nbsp; I proceeded rapidly,
making my way over the downs covered with coarse grass and fern;
with respect to the river of which he had spoken, I reflected
that, either by wading or swimming, I could easily transfer
myself and what I bore to the opposite side.&nbsp; On arriving at
its banks, I found it a beautiful stream, but shallow, with here
and there a deep place, where the water ran dark and still.</p>
<p>Always fond of the pure lymph, I undressed, and plunged into
one of these gulfs, from which I emerged, my whole frame in a
glow, and tingling with delicious sensations.&nbsp; After
conveying my clothes and scanty baggage to the farther side, I
dressed, and then with hurried steps bent my course in the
direction of some lofty ground; I at length found myself on a
high road, leading over wide and arid downs; following the road
for some miles without seeing anything remarkable, I supposed at
length that I had taken the wrong path, and wended on slowly and
disconsolately for some <!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>time, till, having nearly surmounted
a steep hill, I knew at once, from certain appearances, that I
was near the object of my search.&nbsp; Turning to the right near
the brow of the hill, I proceeded along a path which brought me
to a causeway leading over a deep ravine, and connecting the hill
with another which had once formed part of it, for the ravine was
evidently the work of art.&nbsp; I passed over the causeway, and
found myself in a kind of gateway which admitted me into a square
space of many acres, surrounded on all sides by mounds or
ramparts of earth. <a name="citation72a"></a><a
href="#footnote72a" class="citation">[72a]</a>&nbsp; Though I had
never been in such a place before, I knew that I stood within the
precincts of what had been a Roman encampment, and one probably
of the largest size, for many thousand warriors might have found
room to perform their evolutions in that space, in which corn was
now growing, the green ears waving in the morning wind.</p>
<p>After I had gazed about the space for a time, standing in the
gateway formed by the mounds, I clambered up the mound to the
left hand, and on the top of that mound I found myself at a great
altitude; beneath, at the distance of a mile, was a fair old
city, situated amongst verdant meadows, watered with streams, and
from the heart of that old city, from amidst mighty trees, I
beheld towering to the sky the finest spire in the world.</p>
<p>And after I had looked from the Roman rampart for a long time,
I hurried away, and, retracing my steps along the causeway,
regained the road, and, passing over the brow of the hill,
descended to the city of the spire. <a name="citation72b"></a><a

<p>The Hostelry&mdash;Life Uncertain&mdash;Open
Countenance&mdash;The Grand Point&mdash;Thank You, Master&mdash;A
Hard Mother&mdash;Poor Dear!&mdash;Considerable Odds&mdash;The
Better Country&mdash;English Fashion&mdash;Landlord-looking
Person.</p>
<p>And in the old city I remained two days, passing my time as I
best could&mdash;inspecting the curiosities of the place, eating
and drinking when I felt so disposed, which I frequently did, the
digestive organs having assumed a tone to which for many months
they had been strangers&mdash;enjoying at night balmy sleep in a
large bed in a dusky room, at the end of a corridor, in a certain
hostelry in which I had taken up my quarters&mdash;receiving from
the people of the hostelry such civility and condescension as
people who travel on foot with bundle and stick, but who
nevertheless are perceived to be not altogether destitute of
coin, are in the habit of receiving.&nbsp; On the third day, on a
fine sunny afternoon, I departed from the city of the spire.</p>
<p>As I was passing through one of the suburbs, I saw, all on a
sudden, a respectable-looking female fall down in a fit; several
persons hastened to her assistance.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is
dead,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, she is not,&rdquo; said
another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am afraid she is,&rdquo; said <!-- page
74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>a
third.&nbsp; &ldquo;Life is very uncertain,&rdquo; said a
fourth.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is Mrs. ---,&rdquo; said a fifth;
&ldquo;let us carry her to her own house.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not being
able to render any assistance, I left the poor female in the
hands of her townsfolk, and proceeded on my way.&nbsp; I had
chosen a road in the direction of the north-west, it led over
downs where corn was growing, but where neither tree nor hedge
was to be seen; two or three hours&rsquo; walking brought me to a
beautiful valley, abounding with trees of various kinds, with a
delightful village at its farthest extremity; passing through it
I ascended a lofty acclivity, on the top of which I sat down on a
bank, and, taking off my hat, permitted a breeze, which swept
coolly and refreshingly over the downs, to dry my hair, dripping
from the effects of exercise and the heat of the day.</p>
<p>And as I sat there, gazing now at the blue heavens, now at the
downs before me, a man came along the road in the direction in
which I had hitherto been proceeding: just opposite to me he
stopped, and, looking at me, cried&mdash;&ldquo;Am I right for
London, master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was dressed like a sailor, and appeared to be between
twenty-five and thirty years of age&mdash;he had an open manly
countenance, and there was a bold and fearless expression in his
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, in reply to his question;
&ldquo;this is one of the ways to London.&nbsp; Do you come from
far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From ---,&rdquo; said the man, naming a well-known
seaport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the direct road to London from that
place?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but I had to visit two
or <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>three other places on certain commissions I was
entrusted with; amongst others to ---, where I had to take a
small sum of money.&nbsp; I am rather tired, master; and, if you
please, I will sit down beside you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have as much right to sit down here as I
have,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the road is free for every one; as
for sitting down beside me, you have the look of an honest man,
and I have no objection to your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as for being honest, master,&rdquo; said the man,
laughing and sitting down by me, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much to
say&mdash;many is the wild thing I have done when I was younger;
however, what is done, is done.&nbsp; To learn, one must live,
master; and I have lived long enough to learn the grand point of
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That honesty is the best policy, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appear to be a sailor,&rdquo; said I, looking at
his dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not bred a sailor,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;though, when my foot is on the salt water, I can play the
part&mdash;and play it well too.&nbsp; I am now from a long
voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From America?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farther than that,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any objection to tell me?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From New South Wales,&rdquo; said the man, looking me
full in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;Dear me&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very long way off,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that your reason for saying so?&rdquo; said the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the man, with something of a
bitter smile; &ldquo;it was something else that made you say so;
you were thinking of the convicts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what then?&mdash;you are no
convict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not look like one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, master,&rdquo; said the man, cheerfully;
&ldquo;and, to a certain extent, you are right&mdash;bygones are
bygones&mdash;I am no longer what I was, nor ever will be again;
the truth, however, is the truth&mdash;a convict I have
been&mdash;a convict at Sydney Cove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have served out the period for which you were
sentenced, and are now returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to serving out my sentence,&rdquo; replied the man,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I did; I was sentenced for fourteen
years, and I was in Sydney Cove little more than half that
time.&nbsp; The truth is that I did the Government a
service.&nbsp; There was a conspiracy amongst some of the
convicts to murder and destroy&mdash;I overheard and informed the
Government; mind one thing, however, I was not concerned in it;
those who got it up were no comrades of mine, but a bloody gang
of villains.&nbsp; Well, the Government, in consideration of the
service I had done them, remitted the remainder of my sentence;
and some kind gentlemen interested themselves about me, gave me
good books and good advice, and, being satisfied with my conduct,
procured me employ in an exploring expedition, by which I earned
money.&nbsp; In fact, the being sent to Sydney was the best thing
that ever happened to me in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;And you have now returned to your native
country.&nbsp; Longing to see home brought you from New South
Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wish to see England again would never have brought me so
far; for, to tell you the truth, master, England was a hard
mother to me, as she has proved to many.&nbsp; No, a wish to see
another kind of mother&mdash;a poor old woman whose son I
am&mdash;has brought me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a mother, then?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does she reside in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to live in London,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;but I am afraid she is long since dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she support herself?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Support herself! with difficulty enough; she used to
keep a small stall on London Bridge, where she sold fruit; I am
afraid she is dead, and that she died perhaps in misery.&nbsp;
She was a poor sinful creature; but I loved her, and she loved
me.&nbsp; I came all the way back merely for the chance of seeing
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever write to her,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or
cause others to write to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote to her myself,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;about two years ago; but I never received an answer.&nbsp;
I learned to write very tolerably over there, by the assistance
of the good people I spoke of.&nbsp; As for reading, I could do
that very well before I went&mdash;my poor mother taught me to
read, out of a book that she was very fond of; a strange book it
was, I remember.&nbsp; Poor dear!&mdash;what I would give only to
know that she is alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is very uncertain,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said the man, with a sigh.</p>
<p><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;We are here one moment, and gone the next,&rdquo;
I continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I passed through the streets of a
neighbouring town, I saw a respectable woman drop down, and
people said she was dead.&nbsp; Who knows but that she too had a
son coming to see her from a distance, at that very
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, indeed,&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, I am afraid my mother is dead.&nbsp; Well, God&rsquo;s
will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should not wonder at
your finding your mother alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said the man, looking at me
wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not wonder at all,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;indeed, something within me seems to tell me you will; I
should not much mind betting five shillings to five pence that
you will see your mother within a week.&nbsp; Now, friend, five
shillings to five pence&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is very considerable odds,&rdquo; said the man, rubbing
his hands; &ldquo;sure you must have good reason to hope, when
you are willing to give such odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it not unfrequently
happens that those who lay the long odds lose.&nbsp; Let us hope,
however.&nbsp; What do you mean to do in the event of finding
your mother alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I have
frequently thought that if I found my mother alive I would
attempt to persuade her to accompany me to the country which I
have left&mdash;it is a better country for a man&mdash;that is a
free man&mdash;to live in than this; however, let me first find
my mother&mdash;if I could only find my mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said I, rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go your
way, <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>and God go with you&mdash;I will go mine.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have but one thing to ask you,&rdquo; said the
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That you would drink with me before we part&mdash;you have
done me so much good.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How should we
drink?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we are on the top of a hill where
there is nothing to drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But there is a
village below,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;do let us drink before
we part.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been through that village
already,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I do not like turning
back.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the man, sorrowfully,
&ldquo;you will not drink with me because I told you I
was&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are quite mistaken,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I would as soon drink with a convict as with a
judge.&nbsp; I am by no means certain that, under the same
circumstances, the judge would be one whit better than the
convict.&nbsp; Come along!&nbsp; I will go back to oblige
you.&nbsp; I have an odd sixpence in my pocket, which I will
change, that I may drink with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we went down
the hill together to the village through which I had already
passed, where, finding a public-house, we drank together in true
English fashion, after which we parted, the sailor-looking man
going his way and I mine.</p>
<p>After walking about a dozen miles, I came to a town, where I
rested for the night.&nbsp; The next morning I set out again in
the direction of the north-west.&nbsp; I continued journeying for
four days, my daily journeys varying from twenty to twenty-five
miles.&nbsp; During this time nothing occurred to me worthy of
any especial notice.&nbsp; The weather was brilliant, and I
rapidly improved both in strength and spirits.&nbsp; On the fifth
day, about two o&rsquo;clock, I arrived at a small town.&nbsp;
Feeling hungry, I entered a decent-looking inn&mdash;within <!--
page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>a kind of bar I saw a huge, fat, landlord-looking
person, with a very pretty, smartly-dressed maiden.&nbsp;
Addressing myself to the fat man, &ldquo;House!&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;House!&nbsp; Can I have dinner, House?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young gentleman,&rdquo; said the huge fat landlord,
&ldquo;you are come at the right time; dinner will be taken up in
a few minutes; and such a dinner,&rdquo; he continued, rubbing
his hands, &ldquo;as you will not see every day in these
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hot and dusty,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and should
wish to cool my hands and face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny!&rdquo; said the huge landlord, with the utmost
gravity, &ldquo;show the gentleman into number seven, that he may
wash his hands and face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am a person of
primitive habits, and there is nothing like the pump in weather
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jenny,&rdquo; said the landlord, with the same gravity
as before, &ldquo;go with the young gentleman to the pump in the
back kitchen, and take a clean towel along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon the rosy-faced clean-looking damsel went to a
drawer, and producing a large, thick, but snowy white towel, she
nodded to me to <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>follow her; whereupon I followed
Jenny through a long passage into the back kitchen.</p>
<p>And at the end of the back kitchen there stood a pump; and
going to it I placed my hands beneath the spout, and said,
&ldquo;Pump, Jenny;&rdquo; and Jenny incontinently, without
laying down the towel, pumped with one hand, and I washed and
cooled my heated hands.</p>
<p>And, when my hands were washed and cooled, I took off my
neckcloth, and, unbuttoning my shirt collar, I placed my head
beneath the spout of the pump, and I said unto Jenny, &ldquo;Now,
Jenny, lay down the towel, and pump for your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Jenny, placing the towel on a linen-horse, took the
handle of the pump with both hands and pumped over my head as
handmaid had never pumped before; so that the water poured in
torrents from my head, my face, and my hair down upon the brick
floor.</p>
<p>And, after the lapse of somewhat more than a minute, I called
out with a half-strangled voice, &ldquo;Hold, Jenny!&rdquo; and
Jenny desisted.&nbsp; I stood for a few moments to recover my
breath, then taking the towel which Jenny proffered, I dried
composedly my hands and head, my face and hair; then, returning
the towel to Jenny, I gave a deep sigh and said, &ldquo;Surely
this is one of the pleasant moments of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, having set my dress to rights, and combed my hair with a
pocket-comb, I followed Jenny, who conducted me back through the
long passage, and showed me into a neat sanded parlour on the
ground floor.</p>
<p>I sat down by a window which looked out upon the dusty street;
presently in came the handmaid, <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>and commenced
laying the tablecloth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I spread the table for
one, sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;or do you expect anybody to
dine with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I expect anybody,&rdquo; said I,
laughing inwardly to myself; &ldquo;however, if you please you
can lay for two, so that if any acquaintance of mine should
chance to step in, he may find a knife and fork ready for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I sat by the window, sometimes looking out upon the dusty
street, and now glancing at certain old-fashioned prints which
adorned the wall over against me.&nbsp; I fell into a kind of
doze, from which I was almost instantly awakened by the opening
of the door.&nbsp; Dinner, thought I; and I sat upright in my
chair.&nbsp; No, a man of the middle age, and rather above the
middle height, dressed in a plain suit of black, made his
appearance, and sat down in a chair at some distance from me, but
near to the table, and appeared to be lost in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weather is very warm, sir,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said the stranger, laconically, looking at
me for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see the newspaper?&rdquo; said I,
taking up one which lay upon the window seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never read newspapers,&rdquo; said the stranger,
&ldquo;nor, indeed . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever it might be that
he had intended to say he left unfinished.&nbsp; Suddenly he
walked to the mantelpiece at the farther end of the room, before
which he placed himself with his back towards me.&nbsp; There he
remained motionless for some time; at length, raising his hand,
he touched the corner of the mantelpiece with his finger,
advanced towards the chair which he had left, and again seated
himself.</p>
<p><!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;Have you come far?&rdquo; said he, suddenly
looking towards me, and speaking in a frank and open manner,
which denoted a wish to enter into conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
do not seem to be of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come from some distance,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;indeed, I am walking for exercise, which I find as
necessary to the mind as the body.&nbsp; I believe that by
exercise people would escape much mental misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had I uttered these words when the stranger laid his
hand, with seeming carelessness, upon the table, near one of the
glasses; after a moment or two he touched the glass with his
finger as if inadvertently, then, glancing furtively at me, he
withdrew his hand and looked towards the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from these parts?&rdquo; said I at last, with
apparent carelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this vicinity,&rdquo; replied the stranger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You think, then, that it is as easy to walk off the bad
humours of the mind as of the body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, at least, am walking in that hope,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you may be successful,&rdquo; said the stranger;
and here he touched one of the forks which lay on the table near
him.</p>
<p>Here the door, which was slightly ajar, was suddenly pushed
open with some fracas, and in came the stout landlord, supporting
with some difficulty an immense dish, in which was a mighty round
mass of smoking meat garnished all round with vegetables; so high
was the mass that it probably obstructed his view, for it was not
until he had placed it upon the table that he appeared to observe
the stranger; he almost started, and quite out of breath
exclaimed, &ldquo;God bless me, your <!-- page 85--><a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>honour; is
your honour the acquaintance that the young gentleman was
expecting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the young gentleman expecting an
acquaintance?&rdquo; said the stranger.</p>
<p>There is nothing like putting a good face upon these matters,
thought I to myself; and, getting up, I bowed to the
unknown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when I told
Jenny that she might lay the tablecloth for two, so that in the
event of any acquaintance dropping in he might find a knife and
fork ready for him, I was merely jocular, being an entire
stranger in these parts, and expecting no one.&nbsp; Fortune,
however, it would seem has been unexpectedly kind to me; I
flatter myself, sir, that since you have been in this room I have
had the honour of making your acquaintance; and in the strength
of that hope I humbly entreat you to honour me with your company
to dinner, provided you have not already dined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;the round of beef is a
noble one, and seems exceedingly well boiled, and the landlord
was just right when he said I should have such a dinner as is not
seen every day.&nbsp; A round of beef, at any rate such a round
of beef as this, is seldom seen smoking upon the table in these
degenerate times.&nbsp; Allow me, sir,&rdquo; said I, observing
that the stranger was about to speak, &ldquo;allow me another
remark.&nbsp; I think I saw you just now touch the fork, I
venture to hail it as an omen that you will presently seize it,
and apply it to its proper purpose, and its companion the knife
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger changed colour, and gazed upon me in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, sir,&rdquo; here put in the landlord; &ldquo;do,
sir, <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>accept the young gentleman&rsquo;s invitation.&nbsp;
Your honour has of late been looking poorly, and the young
gentleman is a funny young gentleman, and a clever young
gentleman; and I think it will do your honour good to have a
dinner&rsquo;s chat with the young gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my dinner hour,&rdquo; said the stranger;
&ldquo;I dine considerably later; taking anything now would only
discompose me; I shall, however, be most happy to sit down with
the young gentleman; reach me that paper, and, when the young
gentleman has satisfied his appetite, we may perhaps have a
little chat together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord handed the stranger the newspaper, and, bowing,
retired with his maid Jenny.&nbsp; I helped myself to a portion
of the smoking round, and commenced eating with no little
appetite.&nbsp; The stranger appeared to be soon engrossed with
the newspaper.&nbsp; We continued thus a considerable
time&mdash;the one reading and the other dining.&nbsp; Chancing
suddenly to cast my eyes upon the stranger, I saw his brow
contract; he gave a slight stamp with his foot, and flung the
newspaper to the ground, then stooping down he picked it up,
first moving his forefinger along the floor, seemingly slightly
scratching it with his nail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hope, sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by that
ceremony with the finger to preserve yourself from the evil
chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger started; then, after looking at me for some time
in silence, he said, &ldquo;Is it possible that
you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said I, helping myself to some more of
the round, &ldquo;I have touched myself in my younger days, both
for the evil chance and the <!-- page 87--><a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>good.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t say, though, that I ever trusted much in the
ceremony.&rdquo; <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a></p>
<p>The stranger made no reply, but appeared to be in deep
thought; nothing farther passed between us until I had concluded
the dinner, when I said to him, &ldquo;I shall now be most happy,
sir, to have the pleasure of your conversation over a pint of
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger rose; &ldquo;No, my young friend,&rdquo; said he,
smiling, &ldquo;that would scarce be fair.&nbsp; It is my turn
now&mdash;pray do me the favour to go home with me, and accept
what hospitality my poor roof can offer; to tell you the truth, I
wish to have some particular discourse with you which would
hardly be possible in this place.&nbsp; As for wine, I can give
you some much better than you can get here: the landlord is an
excellent fellow, but he is an innkeeper after all.&nbsp; I am
going out for a moment, and will send him in, so that you may
settle your account; I trust you will not refuse me, I only live
about two miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked in the face of the stranger&mdash;it was a fine
intelligent face, with a cast of melancholy in it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I would go with you though you
lived four miles instead of two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that gentleman?&rdquo; said I to the landlord,
after I had settled his bill; &ldquo;I am going home with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;I wish I were going too,&rdquo; said the fat
landlord, laying his hand upon his stomach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young
gentleman, I shall be a loser by his honour&rsquo;s taking you
away; but, after all, the truth is the truth&mdash;there are few
gentlemen in these parts like his honour, either for learning or
welcoming his friends.&nbsp; Young gentleman, I congratulate
you.&rdquo; <a name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"

<p>I found the stranger awaiting me at the door of the inn.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Like yourself, I am fond of walking,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and when any little business calls me to this place I
generally come on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were soon out of the town, and in a very beautiful
country.&nbsp; After proceeding some distance on the high road,
we turned off, and were presently in one of those mazes of lanes
for which England is famous; the stranger at first seemed
inclined to be taciturn; a few observations, however, which I
made appeared to rouse him, and he soon exhibited not only
considerable powers of conversation, but stores of information
which surprised me.&nbsp; So pleased did I become with my new
acquaintance, that I soon ceased to pay the slightest attention
either to place or distance.&nbsp; At length the stranger was
silent, and I perceived that we had arrived at a handsome iron
gate and a lodge; the stranger having rung a bell, the gate was
opened by an old <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>man, and we proceeded along a gravel
path, which in about five minutes brought us to a large brick
house, built something in the old French style, having a spacious
lawn before it, and immediately in front a pond in which were
golden fish, and in the middle a stone swan discharging
quantities of water from its bill.&nbsp; We ascended a spacious
flight of steps to the door, which was at once flung open, and
two servants with powdered hair, and in livery of blue plush,
came out and stood one on either side as we passed the
threshold.&nbsp; We entered a large hall, and the stranger,
taking me by the hand, welcomed me to his poor home, as he called
it, and then gave orders to another servant, but out of livery,
to show me to an apartment, and give me whatever assistance I
might require in my toilet.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the plea as to
primitive habits which I had lately made to my other host in the
town, I offered no objection to this arrangement, but followed
the bowing domestic to a spacious and airy chamber, where he
rendered me all those little nameless offices which the somewhat
neglected state of my dress required.&nbsp; When everything had
been completed to my perfect satisfaction, he told me that if I
pleased he would conduct me to the library, where dinner would be
speedily served.</p>
<p>In the library I found a table laid for two; my host was not
there, having as I supposed not been quite so speedy with his
toilette as his guest.&nbsp; Left alone, I looked round the
apartment with inquiring eyes; it was long and tolerably lofty,
the walls from the top to the bottom were lined with cases
containing books of all sizes and bindings; there was a globe or
two, a couch, and an easy chair.&nbsp; Statues and busts there
were none, and only one <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>painting, a portrait, that of my
host, but not him of the mansion.&nbsp; Over the mantelpiece, the
features staringly like, but so ridiculously exaggerated that
they scarcely resembled those of a human being, daubed evidently
by the hand of the commonest sign-artist, hung a half-length
portrait of him of round of beef celebrity&mdash;my sturdy host
of the town.</p>
<p>I had been in the library about ten minutes, amusing myself as
I best could, when my friend entered; he seemed to have resumed
his taciturnity&mdash;scarce a word escaped his lips till dinner
was served, when he said, smiling, &ldquo;I suppose it would be
merely a compliment to ask you to partake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I, seating myself;
&ldquo;your first course consists of troutlets, I am fond of
troutlets, and I always like to be companionable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dinner was excellent, though I did but little justice to
it from the circumstance of having already dined; the stranger
also, though without my excuse, partook but slightly of the good
cheer; he still continued taciturn, and appeared lost in thought,
and every attempt which I made to induce him to converse was
signally unsuccessful.</p>
<p>And now dinner was removed, and we sat over our wine, and I
remember that the wine was good, and fully justified the
encomiums of my host of the town.&nbsp; Over the wine I made sure
that my entertainer would have loosened the chain which seemed to
tie his tongue&mdash;but no!&nbsp; I endeavoured to tempt him by
various topics, and talked of geometry and the use of the globes,
of the heavenly sphere, and the star Jupiter, which I said I had
heard was a very large star, also of the evergreen tree, which,
according to Olaus, stood of old before the heathen <!-- page
92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>temple of Upsal, and which I affirmed was a
yew&mdash;but no, nothing that I said could induce my entertainer
to relax his taciturnity.</p>
<p>It grew dark, and I became uncomfortable; &ldquo;I must
presently be going,&rdquo; I at last exclaimed.</p>
<p>At these words he gave a sudden start; &ldquo;Going,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;are you not my guest, and an honoured
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know best,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I was
apprehensive I was an intruder; to several of my questions you
have returned no answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten thousand pardons!&rdquo; he exclaimed, seizing me
by the hand; &ldquo;but you cannot go now, I have much to talk to
you about&mdash;there is one thing in
particular&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it be the evergreen tree at Upsal,&rdquo; said I,
interrupting him, &ldquo;I hold it to have been a yew&mdash;what
else?&nbsp; The evergreens of the south, as the old bishop
observes, will not grow in the north, and a pine was unfitted for
such a locality, being a vulgar tree.&nbsp; What else could it
have been but the yew&mdash;the sacred yew which our ancestors
were in the habit of planting in their churchyards?&nbsp;
Moreover, I affirm it to have been the yew for the honour of the
tree; for I love the yew, and had I home and land, I would have
one growing before my front windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would do right, the yew is indeed a venerable tree,
but it is not about the yew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The star Jupiter, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor the star Jupiter, nor its moons; an observation
which escaped you at the inn has made a considerable impression
upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I really must take my departure,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;the dark hour is at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>And as I uttered these latter words the stranger touched
rapidly something which lay near him&mdash;I forget what it
was.&nbsp; It was the first action of the kind which I had
observed on his part since we sat down to table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You allude to the evil chance,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;but it is getting both dark and late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we are going to have a storm,&rdquo; said my
friend, &ldquo;but I really hope that you will give me your
company for a day or two; I have, as I said before, much to talk
to you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall be most happy to be
your guest for this night; I am ignorant of the country, and it
is not pleasant to travel unknown paths by night&mdash;dear me,
what a flash of lightning!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had become very dark; suddenly a blaze of sheet lightning
illumed the room.&nbsp; By the momentary light I distinctly saw
my host touch another object upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you allow me to ask you a question or two?&rdquo;
said he at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you please,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but shall
we not have lights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you particularly wish it,&rdquo; said my
entertainer; &ldquo;I rather like the dark, and though a storm is
evidently at hand, neither thunder nor lightning has any terrors
for me.&nbsp; It is other things I quake at&mdash;I should rather
say ideas.&nbsp; Now permit me to ask you . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then my entertainer asked me various questions, to all of
which I answered unreservedly; he was then silent for some time,
at last he exclaimed, &ldquo;I should wish to tell you the
history of my life&mdash;though not an adventurous one, I think
it contains some things which will interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>Without waiting for my reply he began.&nbsp; Amidst
darkness and gloom, occasionally broken by flashes of lightning,
the stranger related to me, as we sat at table in the library,
his truly touching history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before proceeding to relate the events of my life, it
will not be amiss to give you some account of my ancestors.&nbsp;
My great-grandfather on the male side was a silk mercer, in
Cheapside, who, when he died, left his son, who was his only
child, a fortune of one hundred thousand pounds, and a splendid
business; the son, however, had no inclination for trade, the
summit of his ambition was to be a country gentleman, to found a
family, and to pass the remainder of his days in rural ease and
dignity, and all this he managed to accomplish; he disposed of
his business, purchased a beautiful and extensive estate for four
score thousand pounds, built upon it the mansion to which I had
the honour of welcoming you to-day, married the daughter of a
neighbouring squire, who brought him a fortune of five thousand
pounds, became a magistrate, and only wanted a son and heir to
make him completely happy; this blessing, it is true, was for a
long time denied him; it came, however, at last, as is usual,
when least expected.&nbsp; His lady was brought to bed of my
father, and then who so happy a man as my grandsire; he gave away
two thousand pounds in charities, and in the joy of his heart
made a speech at the next quarter sessions; the rest of his life
was spent in ease, tranquillity, and rural dignity; he died of
apoplexy on the day that my father came of age; perhaps it would
be difficult to mention a man who in all respects was so
fortunate as my grandfather: his death was <!-- page 95--><a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>sudden it is
true, but I am not one of those who pray to be delivered from a
sudden death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not call my father a fortunate man; it is true
that he had the advantage of a first-rate education; that he made
the grand tour with a private tutor, as was the fashion at that
time; that he came to a splendid fortune on the very day that he
came of age; that for many years he tasted all the diversions of
the capital; that, at last determined to settle, he married the
sister of a baronet, an amiable and accomplished lady, with a
large fortune; that he had the best stud of hunters in the
county, on which, during the season, he followed the fox
gallantly; had he been a fortunate man he would never have cursed
his fate, as he was frequently known to do; ten months after his
marriage his horse fell upon him, and so injured him, that he
expired in a few days in great agony.&nbsp; My grandfather was,
indeed, a fortunate man; when he died he was followed to the
grave by the tears of the poor&mdash;my father was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two remarkable circumstances are connected with my
birth&mdash;I am a posthumous child, and came into the world some
weeks before the usual time, the shock which my mother
experienced at my father&rsquo;s death having brought on the
pangs of premature labour; both my mother&rsquo;s life and my own
were at first despaired of; we both, however, survived the
crisis.&nbsp; My mother loved me with the most passionate
fondness, and I was brought up in this house under her own
eye&mdash;I was never sent to school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already told you that mine is not a tale of
adventure; my life has not been one of action, but of wild
imaginings and strange sensations; I <!-- page 96--><a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>was born with
excessive sensibility, and that has been my bane.&nbsp; I have
not been a fortunate man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is fortunate unless he is happy, and it is
impossible for a being constructed like myself to be happy for an
hour, or even enjoy peace and tranquillity; most of our pleasures
and pains are the effects of imagination, and wherever the
sensibility is great, the imagination is great also.&nbsp; No
sooner has my imagination raised up an image of pleasure, than it
is sure to conjure up one of distress and gloom; these two
antagonist ideas instantly commence a struggle in my mind, and
the gloomy one generally, I may say invariably, prevails.&nbsp;
How is it possible that I should be a happy man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has invariably been so with me from the earliest
period that I can remember; the first playthings that were given
me caused me for a few minutes excessive pleasure: they were
pretty and glittering; presently, however, I became anxious and
perplexed, I wished to know their history, how they were made,
and what of&mdash;were the materials precious; I was not
satisfied with their outward appearance.&nbsp; In less than an
hour I had broken the playthings in an attempt to discover what
they were made of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was eight years of age my uncle the baronet, who
was also my godfather, sent me a pair of Norway hawks, with
directions for managing them; he was a great fowler.&nbsp; Oh,
how rejoiced was I with the present which had been made me, my
joy lasted for at least five minutes; I would let them breed, I
would have a house of hawks; yes, that I
would&mdash;but&mdash;and here came the unpleasant
idea&mdash;suppose they were to fly away, how very
annoying!&nbsp; Ah, but, said hope, there&rsquo;s little fear of
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>that; feed them well and they will never fly away, or if
they do they will come back, my uncle says so; so sunshine
triumphed for a little time.&nbsp; Then the strangest of all
doubts came into my head; I doubted the legality of my tenure of
these hawks; how did I come by them? why, my uncle gave them to
me; but how did they come into his possession? what right had he
to them? after all, they might not be his to give.&mdash;I passed
a sleepless night.&nbsp; The next morning I found that the man
who brought the hawks had not departed.&nbsp; &lsquo;How came my
uncle by these hawks?&rsquo; I anxiously inquired.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They were sent to him from Norway, master, with another
pair.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And who sent them?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;That I don&rsquo;t know, master, but I suppose his honour
can tell you.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was even thinking of scrawling a
letter to my uncle to make inquiry on this point, but shame
restrained me, and I likewise reflected that it would be
impossible for him to give my mind entire satisfaction; it is
true he could tell who sent him the hawks, but how was he to know
how the hawks came into the possession of those who sent them to
him, and by what right they possessed them or the parents of the
hawks?&nbsp; In a word, I wanted a clear valid title, as lawyers
would say, to my hawks, and I believe no title would have
satisfied me that did not extend up to the time of the first
hawk, that is, prior to Adam; and, could I have obtained such a
title, I make no doubt that, young as I was, I should have
suspected that it was full of flaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was now disgusted with the hawks, and no wonder,
seeing all the disquietude they had caused me; I soon totally
neglected the poor birds, and they would have starved had not
some of the servants <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>taken compassion upon them and fed
them.&nbsp; My uncle, soon hearing of my neglect, was angry, and
took the birds away; he was a very good-natured man, however, and
soon sent me a fine pony; at first I was charmed with the pony;
soon, however, the same kind of thoughts arose which had
disgusted me on a former occasion.&nbsp; How did my uncle become
possessed of the pony?&nbsp; This question I asked him the first
time I saw him.&nbsp; Oh, he had bought it of a Gypsy, that I
might learn to ride upon it.&nbsp; A Gypsy; I had heard that
Gypsies were great thieves, and I instantly began to fear that
the Gypsy had stolen the pony, and it is probable that for this
apprehension I had better grounds than for many others.&nbsp; I
instantly ceased to set any value upon the pony, but for that
reason, perhaps, I turned it to some account; I mounted it, and
rode it about, which I don&rsquo;t think I should have done had I
looked upon it as a secure possession.&nbsp; Had I looked upon my
title as secure, I should have prized it so much, that I should
scarcely have mounted it for fear of injuring the animal; but
now, caring not a straw for it, I rode it most unmercifully, and
soon became a capital rider.&nbsp; This was very selfish in me,
and I tell the fact with shame.&nbsp; I was punished, however, as
I deserved; the pony had a spirit of its own, and, moreover, it
had belonged to Gypsies; once, as I was riding it furiously over
the lawn, applying both whip and spur, it suddenly lifted up its
heels, and flung me at least five yards over its head.&nbsp; I
received some desperate contusions, and was taken up for dead; it
was many months before I perfectly recovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is time for me to come to the touching part of
my story.&nbsp; There was one thing that I <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>loved better
than the choicest gift which could be bestowed upon me, better
than life itself&mdash;my mother;&mdash;at length she became
unwell, and the thought that I might possibly lose her now rushed
into my mind for the first time; it was terrible, and caused me
unspeakable misery, I may say horror.&nbsp; My mother became
worse, and I was not allowed to enter her apartment, lest by my
frantic exclamations of grief I might aggravate her
disorder.&nbsp; I rested neither day nor night, but roamed about
the house like one distracted.&nbsp; Suddenly I found myself
doing that which even at the time struck me as being highly
singular; I found myself touching particular objects that were
near me, and to which my fingers seemed to be attracted by an
irresistible impulse.&nbsp; It was now the table or the chair
that I was compelled to touch; now the bell-rope; now the handle
of the door; now I would touch the wall, and the next moment
stooping down, I would place the point of my finger upon the
floor: and so I continued to do day after day; frequently I would
struggle to resist the impulse, but invariably in vain.&nbsp; I
have even rushed away from the object, but I was sure to return,
the impulse was too strong to be resisted: I quickly hurried
back, compelled by the feeling within me to touch the
object.&nbsp; Now I need not tell you that what impelled me to
these actions was the desire to prevent my mother&rsquo;s death;
whenever I touched any particular object, it was with the view of
baffling the evil chance, as you would call it&mdash;in this
instance my mother&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A favourable crisis occurred in my mother&rsquo;s
complaint, and she recovered; this crisis took place about six
o&rsquo;clock in the morning; almost simultaneously <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>with it there happened to myself a rather remarkable
circumstance connected with the nervous feeling which was rioting
in my system.&nbsp; I was lying in bed in a kind of uneasy doze,
the only kind of rest which my anxiety, on account of my mother,
permitted me at this time to take, when all at once I sprang up
as if electrified, the mysterious impulse was upon me, and it
urged me to go without delay, and climb a stately elm behind the
house, and touch the topmost branch; otherwise&mdash;you know the
rest&mdash;the evil chance would prevail.&nbsp; Accustomed for
some time as I had been, under this impulse, to perform
extravagant actions, I confess to you that the difficulty and
peril of such a feat startled me; I reasoned against the feeling,
and strove more strenuously than I had ever done before; I even
made a solemn vow not to give way to the temptation, but I
believe nothing less than chains, and those strong ones, could
have restrained me.&nbsp; The demoniac influence, for I can call
it nothing else, at length prevailed; it compelled me to rise, to
dress myself, to descend the stairs, to unbolt the door, and to
go forth; it drove me to the foot of the tree, and it compelled
me to climb the trunk; this was a tremendous task, and I only
accomplished it after repeated falls and trials.&nbsp; When I had
got amongst the branches, I rested for a time, and then set about
accomplishing the remainder of the ascent; this for some time was
not so difficult, for I was now amongst the branches; as I
approached the top, however, the difficulty became greater, and
likewise the danger; but I was a light boy, and almost as nimble
as a squirrel, and, moreover, the nervous feeling was within me,
impelling me upward.&nbsp; It was only by <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>means of a
spring, however, that I was enabled to touch the top of the tree;
I sprang, touched the top of the tree, and fell a distance of at
least twenty feet, amongst the branches; had I fallen to the
bottom I must have been killed, but I fell into the middle of the
tree, and presently found myself astride upon one of the boughs;
scratched and bruised all over, I reached the ground, and
regained my chamber unobserved; I flung myself on my bed quite
exhausted; presently they came to tell me that my mother was
better&mdash;they found me in the state which I have described,
and in a fever besides.&nbsp; The favourable crisis must have
occurred just about the time that I performed the magic touch; it
certainly was a curious coincidence, yet I was not weak enough,
even though a child, to suppose that I had baffled the evil
chance by my daring feat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, all the time that I was performing these
strange feats, I knew them to be highly absurd, yet the impulse
to perform them was irresistible&mdash;a mysterious dread hanging
over me till I had given way to it; even at that early period I
frequently used to reason within myself as to what could be the
cause of my propensity to touch, but of course I could come to no
satisfactory conclusion respecting it; being heartily ashamed of
the practice, I never spoke of it to any one, and was at all
times highly solicitous that no one should observe my
weakness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maternal Anxiety&mdash;The Baronet&mdash;Little
Zest&mdash;Country Life&mdash;Mr. Speaker!&mdash;The
Craving&mdash;Spirited Address&mdash;An Author.</p>
<p>After a short pause my host resumed his narration.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Though I was never sent to school, my education was not
neglected on that account; I had tutors in various branches of
knowledge, under whom I made a tolerable progress; by the time I
was eighteen I was able to read most of the Greek and Latin
authors with facility; I was likewise, to a certain degree, a
mathematician.&nbsp; I cannot say that I took much pleasure in my
studies; my chief aim in endeavouring to accomplish my tasks was
to give pleasure to my beloved parent, who watched my progress
with anxiety truly maternal.&nbsp; My life at this period may be
summed up in a few words; I pursued my studies, roamed about the
woods, walked the green lanes occasionally, cast my fly in a
trout stream, and sometimes, but not often, rode a-hunting with
my uncle.&nbsp; A considerable part of my time was devoted to my
mother, conversing with her and reading to her; youthful
companions I had none, and as to my mother, she lived in the
greatest retirement, devoting herself to the superintendence of
my education, and the practice of acts <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>of charity;
nothing could be more innocent than this mode of life, and some
people say that in innocence there is happiness, yet I
can&rsquo;t say that I was happy.&nbsp; A continual dread
overshadowed my mind, it was the dread of my mother&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; Her constitution had never been strong, and it had
been considerably shaken by her last illness; this I knew, and
this I saw&mdash;for the eyes of fear are marvellously
keen.&nbsp; Well, things went on in this way till I had come of
age; my tutors were then dismissed, and my uncle the baronet took
me in hand, telling my mother that it was high time for him to
exert his authority; that I must see something of the world, for
that, if I remained much longer with her, I should be
ruined.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must consign him to me,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;and I will introduce him to the world.&rsquo;&nbsp; My
mother sighed and consented; so my uncle the baronet introduced
me to the world, took me to horse-races and to London, and
endeavoured to make a man of me according to his idea of the
term, and in part succeeded.&nbsp; I became moderately
dissipated&mdash;I say moderately, for dissipation had but little
zest for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this manner four years passed over.&nbsp; It
happened that I was in London in the height of the season with my
uncle, at his house; one morning he summoned me into the parlour,
he was standing before the fire, and looked very serious.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have had a letter,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;your mother is
very ill.&rsquo;&nbsp; I staggered, and touched the nearest
object to me; nothing was said for two or three minutes, and then
my uncle put his lips to my ear and whispered something.&nbsp; I
fell down senseless.&nbsp; My mother was . . . I remember nothing
for a long <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>time&mdash;for two years I was out
of my mind; at the end of this time I recovered, or partly
so.&nbsp; My uncle the baronet was very kind to me; he advised me
to travel, he offered to go with me.&nbsp; I told him he was very
kind, but I would rather go by myself.&nbsp; So I went abroad,
and saw, amongst other things, Rome and the Pyramids.&nbsp; By
frequent change of scene my mind became not happy, but tolerably
tranquil.&nbsp; I continued abroad some years, when, becoming
tired of travelling, I came home, found my uncle the baronet
alive, hearty, and unmarried, as he still is.&nbsp; He received
me very kindly, took me to Newmarket, and said that he hoped by
this time I was become quite a man of the world; by his advice I
took a house in town, in which I lived during the season.&nbsp;
In summer I strolled from one watering-place to another; and, in
order to pass the time, I became very dissipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last I became as tired of dissipation as I had
previously been of travelling, and I determined to retire to the
country, and live on my paternal estate; this resolution I was
not slow in putting into effect; I sold my house in town,
repaired and refurnished my country house, and, for at least ten
years, lived a regular country life; I gave dinner parties,
prosecuted poachers, was charitable to the poor, and now and then
went into my library; during this time I was seldom or never
visited by the magic impulse, the reason being, that there was
nothing in the wide world for which I cared sufficiently to move
a finger to preserve it.&nbsp; When the ten years, however, were
nearly ended, I started out of bed one morning in a fit of
horror, exclaiming, &lsquo;Mercy, mercy! what will become of <!--
page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>me?&nbsp; I am afraid I shall go mad.&nbsp; I have
lived thirty-five years and upwards without doing anything; shall
I pass through life in this manner?&nbsp; Horror!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then in rapid succession I touched three different
objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dressed myself and went down, determining to set
about something; but what was I to do?&mdash;there was the
difficulty.&nbsp; I ate no breakfast, but walked about the room
in a state of distraction; at last I thought that the easiest way
to do something was to get into Parliament, there would be no
difficulty in that.&nbsp; I had plenty of money, and could buy a
seat; but what was I to do in Parliament?&nbsp; Speak, of
course&mdash;but could I speak?&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try at
once,&rsquo; said I, and forthwith I rushed into the largest
dining-room, and, locking the door, I commenced speaking;
&lsquo;Mr. Speaker,&rsquo; said I, and then I went on speaking
for about ten minutes as I best could, and then I left off, for I
was talking nonsense.&nbsp; No, I was not formed for Parliament;
I could do nothing there.&nbsp; What&mdash;what was I to do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many, many times I thought this question over, but was
unable to solve it; a fear now stole over me that I was unfit for
anything in the world, save the lazy life of vegetation which I
had for many years been leading; yet, if that were the case,
thought I, why the craving within me to distinguish myself?&nbsp;
Surely it does not occur fortuitously, but is intended to rouse
and call into exercise certain latent powers that I possess? and
then with infinite eagerness I set about attempting to discover
these latent powers.&nbsp; I tried an infinity of pursuits,
botany and geology amongst the rest, but in vain; I was fitted
for none of them.&nbsp; I <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>became very
sorrowful and despondent, and at one time I had almost resolved
to plunge again into the whirlpool of dissipation; it was a
dreadful resource, it was true, but what better could I do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was not doomed to return to the dissipation of
the world.&nbsp; One morning a young nobleman, who had for some
time past showed a wish to cultivate my acquaintance, came to me
in a considerable hurry.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am come to beg an
important favour of you,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;one of the county
memberships is vacant&mdash;I intend to become a candidate; what
I want immediately is a spirited address to the electors.&nbsp; I
have been endeavouring to frame one all the morning, but in vain;
I have, therefore, recourse to you as a person of infinite
genius; pray, my dear friend, concoct me one by the
morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What you require of me,&rsquo; I
replied, &lsquo;is impossible; I have not the gift of words; did
I possess it I would stand for the county myself, but I
can&rsquo;t speak.&nbsp; Only the other day I attempted to make a
speech, but left off suddenly, utterly ashamed, although I was
quite alone, of the nonsense I was uttering.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is not a speech that I want,&rsquo; said my friend,
&lsquo;I can talk for three hours without hesitating, but I want
an address to circulate through the county, and I find myself
utterly incompetent to put one together; do oblige me by writing
one for me, I know you can; and, if at any time you want a person
to speak for you, you may command me not for three but for six
hours.&nbsp; Good morning; to-morrow I will breakfast with
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the morning he came again.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what success?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Very poor,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;but judge for
yourself;&rsquo; and I put into his hand a manuscript of several
pages.&nbsp; My <!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>friend read it through with
considerable attention.&nbsp; &lsquo;I congratulate you,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;and likewise myself; I was not mistaken in my
opinion of you; the address is too long by at least two-thirds,
or I should rather say, that it is longer by two-thirds than
addresses generally are; but it will do&mdash;I will not curtail
it of a word.&nbsp; I shall win my election.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in
truth he did win his election; and it was not only his own but
the general opinion that he owed it to the address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, however that might be, I had, by writing the
address, at last discovered what had so long eluded my
search&mdash;what I was able to do.&nbsp; I, who had neither the
nerve nor the command of speech necessary to constitute the
orator&mdash;who had not the power of patient research required
by those who would investigate the secrets of nature, had,
nevertheless, a ready pen and teeming imagination.&nbsp; This
discovery decided my fate&mdash;from that moment I became an
author.&rdquo;</p>

Hard!&mdash;Agricultural Dinner&mdash;Incomprehensible
Actions&mdash;Inmost Bosom&mdash;Give it Up&mdash;Chance
Resemblance&mdash;Rascally Newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An author,&rdquo; said I, addressing my host; &ldquo;is
it possible that I am under the roof of an author?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my host, sighing, &ldquo;my name is so
and so, and I am the author of so and so; it is more than
probable that you have heard both of my name and works.&nbsp; I
will not detain you much longer with my history; the night is
advancing, and the storm appears to be upon the increase.&nbsp;
My life since the period of my becoming an author may be summed
briefly as an almost uninterrupted series of doubts, anxieties,
and trepidations.&nbsp; I see clearly that it is not good to love
anything immoderately in this world, but it has been my
misfortune to love immoderately everything on which I have set my
heart.&nbsp; This is not good, I repeat&mdash;but where is the
remedy?&nbsp; The ancients were always in the habit of saying,
&lsquo;Practise moderation,&rsquo; but the ancients appear to
have considered only one portion of the subject.&nbsp; It is very
possible to practise moderation in some things, in drink and <!--
page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>the like&mdash;to restrain the appetites&mdash;but can
a man restrain the affections of his mind, and tell them, so far
you shall go, and no farther?&nbsp; Alas, no! for the mind is a
subtle principle, and cannot be confined.&nbsp; The winds may be
imprisoned; Homer says that Odysseus carried certain winds in his
ship, confined in leathern bags, but Homer never speaks of
confining the affections.&nbsp; It were but right that those who
exhort us against inordinate affections, and setting our hearts
too much upon the world and its vanities, would tell us how to
avoid doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need scarcely tell you, that no sooner did I become
an author, than I gave myself up immoderately to my
vocation.&nbsp; It became my idol, and, as a necessary
consequence, it has proved a source of misery and disquietude to
me, instead of pleasure and blessing.&nbsp; I had trouble enough
in writing my first work, and I was not long in discovering that
it was one thing to write a stirring and spirited address to a
set of county electors, and another widely different to produce a
work at all calculated to make an impression upon the great
world.&nbsp; I felt, however, that I was in my proper sphere, and
by dint of unwearied diligence and exertion I succeeded in
evolving from the depths of my agitated breast a work which,
though it did not exactly please me, I thought would serve to
make an experiment upon the public; so I laid it before the
public, and the reception which it met with was far beyond my
wildest expectations.&nbsp; The public were delighted with it,
but what were my feelings?&nbsp; Anything, alas! but those of
delight.&nbsp; No sooner did the public express its satisfaction
at the result of my endeavours, than my perverse <!-- page
110--><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>imagination began to conceive a thousand chimerical
doubts; forthwith I sat down to analyse it; and my worst enemy,
and all people have their enemies, especially authors&mdash;my
worst enemy could not have discovered or sought to discover a
tenth part of the faults which I, the author and creator of the
unfortunate production, found or sought to find in it.&nbsp; It
has been said that love makes us blind to the faults of the loved
object&mdash;common love does, perhaps&mdash;the love of a father
to his child, or that of a lover to his mistress, but not the
inordinate love of an author to his works, at least not the love
which one like myself bears to his works: to be brief, I
discovered a thousand faults in my work, which neither public nor
critics discovered.&nbsp; However, I was beginning to get over
this misery, and to forgive my work all its imperfections,
when&mdash;and I shake when I mention it&mdash;the same kind of
idea which perplexed me with regard to the hawks and the Gypsy
pony rushed into my mind, and I forthwith commenced touching the
objects around me, in order to baffle the evil chance, as you
call it; it was neither more nor less than a doubt of the
legality of my claim to the thoughts, expressions, and situations
contained in the book; that is, to all that constituted the
book.&nbsp; How did I get them?&nbsp; How did they come into my
mind?&nbsp; Did I invent them?&nbsp; Did they originate with
myself?&nbsp; Are they my own, or are they some other
body&rsquo;s?&nbsp; You see into what difficulty I had got; I
won&rsquo;t trouble you by relating all that I endured at that
time, but will merely say that after eating my own heart, as the
Italians say, and touching every object that came in my way for
six months, I at length flung my <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>book, I
mean the copy of it which I possessed, into the fire, and began
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was all in vain; I laboured at this other,
finished it, and gave it to the world; and no sooner had I done
so, than the same thought was busy in my brain, poisoning all the
pleasure which I should otherwise have derived from my
work.&nbsp; How did I get all the matter which composed it?&nbsp;
Out of my own mind, unquestionably; but how did it come
there&mdash;was it the indigenous growth of the mind?&nbsp; And
then I would sit down and ponder over the various scenes and
adventures in my book, endeavouring to ascertain how I came
originally to devise them, and by dint of reflecting I remembered
that to a single word in conversation, or some simple accident in
a street, or on a road, I was indebted for some of the happiest
portions of my work; they were but tiny seeds, it is true, which
in the soil of my imagination had subsequently become stately
trees, but I reflected that without them no stately trees would
have been produced, and that, consequently, only a part in the
merit of these compositions which charmed the world&mdash;for
they did charm the world&mdash;was due to myself.&nbsp; Thus, a
dead fly was in my phial, poisoning all the pleasure which I
should otherwise have derived from the result of my brain
sweat.&nbsp; &lsquo;How hard!&rsquo; I would exclaim, looking up
to the sky, &lsquo;how hard!&nbsp; I am like Virgil&rsquo;s
sheep, bearing fleeces not for themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, not
to tire you, it fared with my second work as it did with my
first; I flung it aside, and, in order to forget it, I began a
third, on which I am now occupied; but the difficulty of writing
it is immense, my extreme desire to be original sadly cramping
the powers of <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>my mind; my fastidiousness being so
great that I invariably reject whatever ideas I do not think to
be legitimately my own.&nbsp; But there is one circumstance to
which I cannot help alluding here, as it serves to show what
miseries this love of originality must needs bring upon an
author.&nbsp; I am constantly discovering that, however original
I may wish to be, I am continually producing the same things
which other people say or write.&nbsp; Whenever, after producing
something which gives me perfect satisfaction, and which has cost
me perhaps days and nights of brooding, I chance to take up a
book for the sake of a little relaxation, a book which I never
saw before, I am sure to find in it something more or less
resembling some part of what I have been just composing.&nbsp;
You will easily conceive the distress which then comes over me;
&rsquo;tis then that I am almost tempted to execrate the chance
which, by discovering my latent powers, induced me to adopt a
profession of such anxiety and misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some time past I have given up reading almost
entirely, owing to the dread which I entertain of lighting upon
something similar to what I myself have written.&nbsp; I scarcely
ever transgress without having almost instant reason to
repent.&nbsp; To-day, when I took up the newspaper, I saw in a
speech of the Duke of Rhododendron, at an agricultural dinner,
the very same ideas, and almost the same expressions which I had
put into the mouth of an imaginary personage of mine, on a widely
different occasion; you saw how I dashed the newspaper
down&mdash;you saw how I touched the floor; the touch was to
baffle the evil chance, to prevent the critics detecting any
similarity between <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the speech of the Duke of
Rhododendron at the agricultural dinner, and the speech of my
personage.&nbsp; My sensibility on the subject of my writings is
so great, that sometimes a chance word is sufficient to unman me,
I apply it to them in a superstitious sense; for example, when
you said some time ago that the dark hour was coming on, I
applied it to my works&mdash;it appeared to bode them evil
fortune; you saw how I touched, it was to baffle the evil chance;
but I do not confine myself to touching when the fear of the evil
chance is upon me.&nbsp; To baffle it I occasionally perform
actions which must appear highly incomprehensible; I have been
known, when riding in company with other people, to leave the
direct road, and make a long circuit by a miry lane to the place
to which we were going.&nbsp; I have also been seen attempting to
ride across a morass, where I had no business whatever, and in
which my horse finally sank up to its saddle-girths, and was only
extricated by the help of a multitude of hands.&nbsp; I have, of
course, frequently been asked the reason of such conduct, to
which I have invariably returned no answer, for I scorn
duplicity; whereupon people have looked mysteriously, and
sometimes put their fingers to their foreheads.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
yet it can&rsquo;t be,&rsquo; I once heard an old gentleman say;
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t we know what he is capable of?&rsquo; and the
old man was right; I merely did these things to avoid the evil
chance, impelled by the strange feeling within me; and this evil
chance is invariably connected with my writings, the only things
at present which render life valuable to me.&nbsp; If I touch
various objects, and ride into miry places, it is to baffle any
mischance befalling me as an author, to prevent my books getting
into disrepute; in nine <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>cases out
of ten to prevent any expressions, thoughts, or situations in any
work which I am writing from resembling the thoughts,
expressions, and situations of other authors, for my great wish,
as I told you before, is to be original.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have now related my history, and have revealed to you
the secrets of my inmost bosom.&nbsp; I should certainly not have
spoken so unreservedly as I have done, had I not discovered in
you a kindred spirit.&nbsp; I have long wished for an opportunity
of discoursing on the point which forms the peculiar feature of
my history with a being who could understand me; and truly it was
a lucky chance which brought you to these parts; you who seem to
be acquainted with all things strange and singular, and who are
as well acquainted with the subject of the magic touch as with
all that relates to the star Jupiter, or the mysterious tree at
Upsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the story which my host related to me in the library,
amidst the darkness, occasionally broken by flashes of
lightning.&nbsp; Both of us remained silent for some time after
it was concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a singular story,&rdquo; said I, at last,
&ldquo;though I confess that I was prepared for some part of
it.&nbsp; Will you permit me to ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said my host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never speak in public?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you made this speech of yours in the
dining-room, commencing with Mr. Speaker, no one was
present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None in the world, I double-locked the door; <a
name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a> what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An idea came into my head&mdash;dear me, how the <!--
page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>rain is pouring!&mdash;but, with respect to your
present troubles and anxieties, would it not be wise, seeing that
authorship causes you so much trouble and anxiety, to give it up
altogether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you an author yourself,&rdquo; replied my host,
&ldquo;you would not talk in this manner; once an author, ever an
author&mdash;besides, what could I do? return to my former state
of vegetation? no, much as I endure, I do not wish that; besides,
every now and then my reason tells me that these troubles and
anxieties of mine are utterly without foundation; that whatever I
write is the legitimate growth of my own mind, and that it is the
height of folly to afflict myself at any chance resemblance
between my own thoughts and those of other writers, such
resemblance being inevitable from the fact of our common human
origin.&nbsp; In short&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;notwithstanding
your troubles and anxieties you find life very tolerable; has
your originality ever been called in question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, every one declares that originality
constitutes the most remarkable feature of my writings; the man
has some faults, they say, but want of originality is certainly
not one of them.&nbsp; He is quite different from others&mdash;a
certain newspaper, it is true, the ---, I think, once insinuated
that in a certain work of mine I had taken a hint or two from the
writings of a couple of authors which it mentioned; it happened,
however, that I had never even read one syllable of the writings
of either, and of one of them had never even heard the name; so
much for the discrimination of the ---.&nbsp; By the bye, what a
rascally newspaper that is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very rascally newspaper,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>During the greater part of that night my slumbers were

to frame a book.&nbsp; And now the book was finished and given to

me, and I shrank from the eyes of the world.&nbsp; And, when I
got into retired places, I touched various objects in order to
baffle the evil chance.&nbsp; In short, during the whole night, I
was acting over the story which I had heard before I went to
bed.</p>
<p>At about eight o&rsquo;clock I awoke.&nbsp; The storm had long
since passed away, and the morning was bright and shining; my
couch was so soft and luxurious that I felt loth to quit it, so I
lay some time, my eyes wandering about the magnificent room to
which fortune had conducted me in so <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>singular a
manner; at last I heaved a sigh; I was thinking of my own
homeless condition, and imagining where I should find myself on
the following morning.&nbsp; Unwilling, however, to indulge in
melancholy thoughts, I sprang out of bed and proceeded to dress
myself, and, whilst dressing, I felt an irresistible inclination
to touch the bedpost.</p>
<p>I finished dressing and left the room, feeling compelled,
however, as I left it, to touch the lintel of the door.&nbsp; Is
it possible, thought I, that from what I have lately heard the
long-forgotten influence should have possessed me again? but I
will not give way to it; so I hurried downstairs, resisting as I
went a certain inclination which I occasionally felt to touch the
rail of the banister.&nbsp; I was presently upon the gravel walk
before the house: it was indeed a glorious morning.&nbsp; I stood
for some time observing the golden fish disporting in the waters
of the pond, and then strolled about amongst the noble trees of
the park; the beauty and freshness of the morning&mdash;for the
air had been considerably cooled by the late storm&mdash;soon
enabled me to cast away the gloomy ideas which had previously
taken possession of my mind, and, after a stroll of about half an
hour, I returned towards the house in high spirits.&nbsp; It is
true that once I felt very much inclined to go and touch the
leaves of a flowery shrub which I saw at some distance, and had
even moved two or three paces towards it; but, bethinking myself,
I manfully resisted the temptation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Begone!&rdquo; I
exclaimed, &ldquo;ye sorceries, in which I formerly
trusted&mdash;begone for ever vagaries which I had almost
forgotten; good luck is not to be obtained, or bad averted, by
<!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>magic touches; besides, two wizards in one parish would
be too much, in all conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned to the house, and entered the library; breakfast
was laid on the table, and my friend was standing before the
portrait which I have already said hung above the mantelpiece; so
intently was he occupied in gazing at it that he did not hear me
enter, nor was aware of my presence till I advanced close to him
and spoke, when he turned round and shook me by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can possibly have induced you to hang up that
portrait in your library? it is a staring likeness, it is true,
but it appears to me a wretched daub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daub as you call it,&rdquo; said my friend, smiling,
&ldquo;I would not part with it for the best piece of
Raphael.&nbsp; For many a happy thought I am indebted to that
picture&mdash;it is my principal source of inspiration; when my
imagination flags, as of course it occasionally does, I stare
upon those features, and forthwith strange ideas of fun and
drollery begin to flow into my mind; these I round, amplify, or
combine into goodly creations, and bring forth as I find an
opportunity.&nbsp; It is true that I am occasionally tormented by
the thought that, by doing this, I am committing plagiarism;
though, in that case, all thoughts must be plagiarisms, all that
we think being the result of what we hear, see, or feel.&nbsp;
What can I do?&nbsp; I must derive my thoughts from some source
or other; and, after all, it is better to plagiarise from the
features of my landlord than from the works of Butler and
Cervantes.&nbsp; My works, as you are aware, are of a serio-comic
character.&nbsp; My neighbours <!-- page 119--><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>are of
opinion that I am a great reader, and so I am, but only of those
features&mdash;my real library is that picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you obtain it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some years ago a travelling painter came into this
neighbourhood, and my jolly host, at the request of his wife,
consented to sit for his portrait; she highly admired the
picture, but she soon died, and then my fat friend, who is of an
affectionate disposition, said he could not bear the sight of it,
as it put him in mind of his poor wife.&nbsp; I purchased it of
him for five pounds&mdash;I would not take five thousand for it;
when you called that picture a daub, you did not see all the
poetry of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We sat down to breakfast; my entertainer appeared to be in
much better spirits than on the preceding day; I did not observe
him touch once; ere breakfast was over a servant
entered&mdash;&ldquo;The Reverend Mr. Platitude, sir,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>A shade of dissatisfaction came over the countenance of my
host.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does the silly pestilent fellow mean by
coming here?&rdquo; said he, half to himself; &ldquo;let him come
in,&rdquo; said he to the servant.</p>
<p>The servant went out, and in a moment reappeared, introducing
the Reverend Mr. Platitude.&nbsp; The Reverend Mr. Platitude,
having what is vulgarly called a game leg, came shambling into
the room; he was about thirty years of age, and about five feet
three inches high; his face was of the colour of pepper, and
nearly as rugged as a nutmeg grater; his hair was black; with his
eyes he squinted, and grinned with his lips, which were very much
apart, disclosing two very irregular rows of teeth; he was
dressed in the true Levitical <!-- page 120--><a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>fashion, in
a suit of spotless black, and a neckerchief of spotless
white.</p>
<p>The Reverend Mr. Platitude advanced winking and grinning to my
entertainer, who received him politely but with evident coldness;
nothing daunted, however, the Reverend Mr. Platitude took a seat
by the table, and, being asked to take a cup of coffee, winked,
grinned, and consented.</p>
<p>In company I am occasionally subject to fits of what is
generally called absence; my mind takes flight and returns to
former scenes, or presses forward into the future.&nbsp; One of
these fits of absence came over me at this time&mdash;I looked at
the Reverend Mr. Platitude for a moment, heard a word or two that
proceeded from his mouth, and saying to myself, &ldquo;You are no
man for me,&rdquo; fell into a fit of musing&mdash;into the same
train of thought as in the morning, no very pleasant one&mdash;I
was thinking of the future.</p>
<p>I continued in my reverie for some time, and probably should
have continued longer, had I not been suddenly aroused by the
voice of Mr. Platitude raised to a very high key.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, my dear sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is but too
true; I have it on good authority&mdash;a gone Church&mdash;a
lost Church&mdash;a ruined Church&mdash;a demolished Church is
the Church of England.&nbsp; Toleration to Dissenters! oh,
monstrous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said my host, &ldquo;that the repeal
of the Test Acts will be merely a precursor of the emancipation
of the Papists?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the Catholics,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mr.
Platitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ahem.&nbsp; There was a time, as I
believe you are aware, my dear sir, when I was as much opposed to
the emancipation of the Catholics <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>as it was
possible for any one to be; but I was prejudiced, my dear sir,
labouring under a cloud of most unfortunate prejudice; but I
thank my Maker I am so no longer.&nbsp; I have travelled, as you
are aware.&nbsp; It is only by travelling that one can rub off
prejudices; I think you will agree with me there.&nbsp; I am
speaking to a traveller.&nbsp; I left behind all my prejudices in
Italy.&nbsp; The Catholics are at least our
fellow-Christians.&nbsp; I thank Heaven that I am no longer an
enemy to Catholic emancipation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you would not tolerate Dissenters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissenters, my dear sir; I hope you would not class
such a set as the Dissenters with Catholics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be unjust,&rdquo; said my host,
&ldquo;though to which of the two parties is another thing; but
permit me to ask you a question: Does it not smack somewhat of
paradox to talk of Catholics, whilst you admit there are
Dissenters?&nbsp; If there are Dissenters, how should there be
Catholics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my fault that there are Dissenters,&rdquo;
said the Reverend Mr. Platitude; &ldquo;if I had my will I would
neither admit there were any, nor permit any to be.&rdquo; <a
name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121"
class="citation">[121]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would admit there were such as long as
they existed; but how would you get rid of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have the Church exert its authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by exerting its authority?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not have the Church bear the sword in
vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;What, the sword of St. Peter?&nbsp; You remember
what the Founder of the religion which you profess said about the
sword, &lsquo;He who striketh with it . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; I think
those who have called themselves the Church have had enough of
the sword.&nbsp; Two can play with the sword, Mr.
Platitude.&nbsp; The Church of Rome tried the sword with the
Lutherans: how did it fare with the Church of Rome?&nbsp; The
Church of England tried the sword, Mr. Platitude, with the
Puritans: how did it fare with Laud and Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as for the Church of England,&rdquo; said Mr.
Platitude, &ldquo;I have little to say.&nbsp; Thank God, I left
all my Church of England prejudices in Italy.&nbsp; Had the
Church of England known its true interests, it would long ago
have sought a reconciliation with its illustrious mother.&nbsp;
If the Church of England had not been in some degree a schismatic
church, it would not have fared so ill at the time of which you
are speaking; the rest of the Church would have come to its
assistance.&nbsp; The Irish would have helped it, so would the
French, so would the Portuguese.&nbsp; Disunion has always been
the bane of the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more I fell into a reverie.&nbsp; My mind now reverted to
the past; methought I was in a small comfortable room wainscoted
with oak; I was seated on one side of a fireplace, close by a
table on which were wine and fruit; on the other side of the fire
sat a man in a plain suit of brown, with the hair combed back
from his somewhat high forehead; he had a pipe in his mouth,
which for some time he smoked gravely and placidly, without
saying a word; at length, after drawing at the pipe for some time
rather vigorously, he removed it from his <!-- page 123--><a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>mouth, and,
emitting an accumulated cloud of smoke, he exclaimed in a slow
and measured tone, &ldquo;As I was telling you just now, my good
chap, I have always been an enemy to humbug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I awoke from my reverie the Reverend Mr. Platitude was
quitting the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that person?&rdquo; said I to my entertainer, as
the door closed behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; said my host; &ldquo;why, the Rev.
Mr. Platitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he reside in this neighbourhood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He holds a living about three miles from here; his
history, as far as I am acquainted with it, is as follows.&nbsp;
His father was a respectable tanner in the neighbouring town,
who, wishing to make his son a gentleman, sent him to
college.&nbsp; Having never been at college myself, I cannot say
whether he took the wisest course; I believe it is more easy to
unmake than to make a gentleman; I have known many gentlemanly
youths go to college, and return anything but what they
went.&nbsp; Young Mr. Platitude did not go to college a
gentleman, but neither did he return one; he went to college an
ass, and returned a prig; to his original folly was superadded a
vast quantity of conceit.&nbsp; He told his father that he had
adopted high principles, and was determined to discountenance
everything low and mean; advised him to eschew trade, and to
purchase him a living.&nbsp; The old man retired from business,
purchased his son a living, and shortly after died, leaving him
what remained of his fortune.&nbsp; The first thing the Reverend
Mr. Platitude did, after his father&rsquo;s decease, was to send
his mother and sister into Wales to live upon a small annuity,
assigning as a reason that he was <!-- page 124--><a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>averse to
anything low, and that they talked ungrammatically.&nbsp; Wishing
to shine in the pulpit, he now preached high sermons, as he
called them, interspersed with scraps of learning.&nbsp; His
sermons did not, however, procure him much popularity; on the
contrary, his church soon became nearly deserted, the greater
part of his flock going over to certain Dissenting preachers, who
had shortly before made their appearance in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Mr. Platitude was filled with wrath, and
abused Dissenters in most unmeasured terms.&nbsp; Coming in
contact with some of the preachers at a public meeting, he was
rash enough to enter into argument with them.&nbsp; Poor
Platitude! he had better have been quiet, he appeared like a
child, a very infant, in their grasp; he attempted to take
shelter under his college learning, but found, to his dismay,
that his opponents knew more Greek and Latin than himself.&nbsp;
These illiterate boors, as he had supposed them, caught him at
once in a false concord, and Mr. Platitude had to slink home
overwhelmed with shame.&nbsp; To avenge himself he applied to the
ecclesiastical court, but was told that the Dissenters could not
be put down by the present ecclesiastical law.&nbsp; He found the
Church of England, to use his own expression, a poor, powerless,
restricted Church.&nbsp; He now thought to improve his
consequence by marriage, and made up to a rich and beautiful
young lady in the neighbourhood; the damsel measured him from
head to foot with a pair of very sharp eyes, dropped a curtsey,
and refused him.&nbsp; Mr. Platitude, finding England a very
stupid place, determined to travel; he went to Italy; how he
passed his time there he knows best, to other people it is a
matter of little importance.&nbsp; <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>At the end
of two years he returned with a real or assumed contempt for
everything English, and especially for the Church to which he
belongs, and out of which he is supported.&nbsp; He forthwith
gave out that he had left behind him all his Church of England
prejudices, and, as a proof thereof, spoke against sacerdotal
wedlock and the toleration of schismatics.&nbsp; In an evil hour
for myself he was introduced to me by a clergyman of my
acquaintance, and from that time I have been pestered, as I was
this morning, at least once a week.&nbsp; I seldom enter into any
discussion with him, but fix my eyes on the portrait over the
mantelpiece, and endeavour to conjure up some comic idea or
situation, whilst he goes on talking tomfoolery by the hour about
church authority, schismatics, and the unlawfulness of sacerdotal
wedlock; occasionally he brings with him a strange kind of being,
whose acquaintance he says he made in Italy,&mdash;I believe he
is some sharking priest who has come over to proselytise and
plunder.&nbsp; This being has some powers of conversation and
some learning, but carries the countenance of an arch villain;
Platitude is evidently his tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what religion are you?&rdquo; said I to my host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of the Vicar of Wakefield&mdash;good, quiet,
Church of England, which would live and let live, practises
charity, and rails at no one; where the priest is the husband of
one wife, takes care of his family and his parish&mdash;such is
the religion for me, though I confess I have hitherto thought too
little of religious matters.&nbsp; When, however, I have
completed this plaguy work on which I am engaged, I hope to be
able to devote more attention to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some farther conversation, the subjects <!-- page
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>being, if I remember right, college education,
priggism, church authority, tomfoolery, and the like, I rose and
said to my host, &ldquo;I must now leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whither are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here, then&mdash;you shall be welcome as many
days, months, and years as you please to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would hang upon another man?&nbsp; No,
not if he were Emperor of all the Chinas.&nbsp; I will now make
my preparations, and then bid you farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I retired to my apartment and collected the handful of things
which I carried with me on my travels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will walk a little way with you,&rdquo; said my
friend on my return.</p>
<p>He walked with me to the park gate; neither of us said
anything by the way.&nbsp; When we had come upon the road, I
said, &ldquo;Farewell now; I will not permit you to give yourself
any farther trouble on my account.&nbsp; Receive my best thanks
for your kindness; before we part, however, I should wish to ask
you a question.&nbsp; Do you think you shall ever grow tired of
authorship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my fears,&rdquo; said my friend, advancing his
hand to one of the iron bars of the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is a bad
habit.&nbsp; I have but one word to add: should you ever grow
tired of authorship follow your first idea of getting into
Parliament; you have words enough at command; perhaps you want
manner and method; but, in that case, you must apply to a
teacher, you must take lessons of a master of
elocution.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;That would never do!&rdquo; said my host;
&ldquo;I know myself too well to think of applying for assistance
to any one.&nbsp; Were I to become a parliamentary orator, I
should wish to be an original one, even if not above
mediocrity.&nbsp; What pleasure should I take in any speech I
might make, however original as to thought, provided the gestures
I employed and the very modulation of my voice were not my
own?&nbsp; Take lessons, indeed! why, the fellow who taught me,
the professor, might be standing in the gallery whilst I spoke;
and, at the best parts of my speech, might say to himself,
&lsquo;That gesture is mine&mdash;that modulation is
mine.&rsquo;&nbsp; I could not bear the thought of such a
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and may you
prosper.&nbsp; I have nothing more to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I departed.&nbsp; At the distance of twenty yards I turned
round suddenly; my friend was just withdrawing his finger from
the bar of the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been touching,&rdquo; said I, as I proceeded on
my way; &ldquo;I wonder what was the evil chance he wished to
baffle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After walking some time, I found myself on the great road, at
the same spot where I had turned aside the day before with my
new-made acquaintance, in the direction of his house.&nbsp; I now
continued my journey as before, towards the north.&nbsp; The
weather, though beautiful, was much cooler than it had been for
some time past; I walked at a great rate, with a springing and
elastic step.&nbsp; In about two hours I came to where a kind of
cottage stood a little way back from the road, with a huge oak
before it, under the shade of which stood a little pony and a
cart, which seemed to contain various articles.&nbsp; I was going
past&mdash;when I saw scrawled over the door of the cottage,
&ldquo;Good beer sold here;&rdquo; upon which, feeling myself all
of a sudden very thirsty, I determined to go in and taste the
beverage.</p>
<p>I entered a well-sanded kitchen, and seated myself on a bench,
on one side of a long white <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>table; the
other side, which was nearest to the wall, was occupied by a
party, or rather family, consisting of a grimy-looking man,
somewhat under the middle size, dressed in faded velveteens, and
wearing a leather apron&mdash;a rather pretty-looking woman, but
sun-burnt, and meanly dressed, and two ragged children, a boy and
girl, about four or five years old.&nbsp; The man sat with his
eyes fixed upon the table, supporting his chin with both his
hands; the woman, who was next him, sat quite still, save that
occasionally she turned a glance upon her husband with eyes that
appeared to have been lately crying.&nbsp; The children had none
of the vivacity so general at their age.&nbsp; A more
disconsolate family I had never seen; a mug, which, when filled,
might contain half a pint, stood empty before them; a very
disconsolate party indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;House!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;House!&rdquo; and then as
nobody appeared, I cried again as loud as I could, &ldquo;House!
do you hear me, House!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your pleasure, young man?&rdquo; said an
elderly woman, who now made her appearance from a side
apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To taste your ale,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; said the woman, stretching out her
hand towards the empty mug upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The largest measure-full in your house,&rdquo; said I,
putting back her hand gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is not the season
for half-pint mugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you will, young man,&rdquo; said the landlady; and
presently brought in an earthen pitcher which might contain about
three pints, and which foamed and frothed withal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will this pay for it?&rdquo; said I, putting down
sixpence.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&ldquo;I have to return you a penny,&rdquo; said the
landlady, putting her hand into her pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want no change,&rdquo; said I, flourishing my hand
with an air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, young gentleman,&rdquo; said the
landlady, and then making a kind of curtsey, she again retired to
the side apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your health, sir,&rdquo; said I to the
grimy-looking man, as I raised the pitcher to my lips.</p>
<p>The tinker, for such I supposed him to be, without altering
his posture, raised his eyes, looked at me for a moment, gave a
slight nod, and then once more fixed his eyes upon the
table.&nbsp; I took a draught of the ale, which I found
excellent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you drink?&rdquo; said I,
holding the pitcher to the tinker.</p>
<p>The man again lifted up his eyes, looked at me, and then at
the pitcher, and then at me again.&nbsp; I thought at one time
that he was about to shake his head in sign of refusal, but no,
he looked once more at the pitcher, and the temptation was too
strong.&nbsp; Slowly removing his head from his arms, he took the
pitcher, sighed, nodded, and drank a tolerable quantity, and then
set the pitcher down before me upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better mend your draught,&rdquo; said I to the
tinker, &ldquo;it is a sad heart that never rejoices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said the tinker, and again
raising the pitcher to his lips, he mended his draught as I had
bidden him, drinking a larger quantity than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pass it to your wife,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The poor woman took the pitcher from the man&rsquo;s hand;
before, however, raising it to her lips, she looked at the
children.&nbsp; True mother&rsquo;s heart, thought I to myself,
and taking the half-pint mug, <!-- page 131--><a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>I made her
fill it, and then held it to the children, causing each to take a
draught.&nbsp; The woman wiped her eyes with the corner of her
gown, before she raised the pitcher and drank to my health.</p>
<p>In about five minutes none of the family looked half so
disconsolate as before, and the tinker and I were in deep
discourse.</p>
<p>Oh, genial and gladdening is the power of good ale, the true
and proper drink of Englishmen.&nbsp; He is not deserving of the
name of Englishman who speaketh against ale, that is good ale,
like that which has just made merry the hearts of this poor
family; and yet there are beings, calling themselves Englishmen,
who say that it is a sin to drink a cup of ale, and who on coming
to this passage will be tempted to fling down the book and
exclaim, &ldquo;The man is evidently a bad man, for behold, by
his own confession, he is not only fond of ale himself, but is in
the habit of tempting other people with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alas!
alas! what a number of silly individuals there are in this world;
I wonder what they would have had me do in this
instance&mdash;given the afflicted family a cup of cold water? go
to!&nbsp; They could have found water in the road, for there was
a pellucid spring only a few yards distant from the house, as
they were well aware&mdash;but they wanted not water.&nbsp; What
should I have given them? meat and bread? go to!&nbsp; They were
not hungry; there was stifled sobbing in their bosoms, and the
first mouthful of strong meat would have choked them.&nbsp; What
should I have given them?&nbsp; Money! what right had I to insult
them by offering them money?&nbsp; Advice! words, words, words;
friends, there is a time for everything; <!-- page 132--><a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>there is a
time for a cup of cold water; there is a time for strong meat and
bread; there is a time for advice, and there is a time for ale;
and I have generally found that the time for advice is after a
cup of ale.&nbsp; I do not say many cups; the tongue then
speaketh more smoothly, and the ear listeneth more benignantly;
but why do I attempt to reason with you? do I not know you for
conceited creatures, with one idea&mdash;and that a foolish
one;&mdash;a crotchet, for the sake of which ye would sacrifice
anything, religion if required&mdash;country?&nbsp; There, fling
down my book, I do not wish ye to walk any farther in my company,
unless you cast your nonsense away, which ye will never do, for
it is the breath of your nostrils; fling down my book, it was not
written to support a crotchet, for know one thing, my good
people, I have invariably been an enemy to humbug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the tinker, after we had discoursed
some time, &ldquo;I little thought, when I first saw you, that
you were of my own trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Nor am I, at least not exactly.&nbsp;
There is not much difference, &rsquo;tis true, between a tinker
and a smith.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; You are a whitesmith then?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Not I, I&rsquo;d scorn to be anything so
mean; no, friend, black&rsquo;s the colour; I am a brother of the
horse-shoe.&nbsp; Success to the hammer and tongs.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Well, I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you
had been a blacksmith by your hands.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I have seen them, however, as black as
yours.&nbsp; The truth is, I have not worked for many a day.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Where did you serve first?</p>
<p><!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; In Ireland.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a good way off, isn&rsquo;t
it?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Not very far; over those mountains to the
left, and the run of salt water that lies behind them,
there&rsquo;s Ireland.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fine thing to be a
scholar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Not half so fine as to be a tinker.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; How you talk!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Nothing but the truth; what can be better
than to be one&rsquo;s own master?&nbsp; Now a tinker is his own
master, a scholar is not.&nbsp; Let us suppose the best of
scholars, a schoolmaster for example, for I suppose you will
admit that no one can be higher in scholarship than a
schoolmaster; do you call his a pleasant life?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t; we should call him a school-slave, rather than a
schoolmaster.&nbsp; Only conceive him in blessed weather like
this, in his close school, teaching children to write in
copy-books, &ldquo;Evil communication corrupts good
manners,&rdquo; or &ldquo;You cannot touch pitch without
defilement,&rdquo; or to spell out of Abedariums, or to read out
of Jack Smith, or Sandford and Merton.&nbsp; Only conceive him, I
say, drudging in such guise from morning till night, without any
rational enjoyment but to beat the children.&nbsp; Would you
compare such a dog&rsquo;s life as that with your own&mdash;the
happiest under heaven&mdash;true Eden life, as the Germans would
say,&mdash;pitching your tent under the pleasant hedge-rows,
listening to the song of the feathered tribes, collecting all the
leaky kettles in the neighbourhood, soldering and joining,
earning your honest bread by the wholesome sweat of your
brow&mdash;making ten holes&mdash;hey, what&rsquo;s this?
what&rsquo;s the man crying for?</p>
<p>Suddenly the tinker had covered his face with <!-- page
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>his hands, and begun to sob and moan like a man in the
deepest distress; the breast of his wife was heaved with emotion;
even the children were agitated, the youngest began to roar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter with you; what
are you all crying about?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i> (uncovering his face).&nbsp; Lord, why to hear
you talk; isn&rsquo;t that enough to make anybody cry&mdash;even
the poor babes?&nbsp; Yes, you said right, &rsquo;tis life in the
Garden of Eden&mdash;the tinker&rsquo;s; I see so now that
I&rsquo;m about to give it up.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Give it up! you must not think of such a
thing.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; No, I can&rsquo;t bear to think of it,
and yet I must; what&rsquo;s to be done?&nbsp; How hard to be
frightened to death, to be driven off the roads!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who has driven you off the roads?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Who! the Flaming Tinman.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who is he?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; The biggest rogue in England, and the
cruellest, or he wouldn&rsquo;t have served me as he has
done&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it.&nbsp; I was born
upon the roads, and so was my father before me, and my mother
too; and I worked with them as long as they lived, as a dutiful
child, for I have nothing to reproach myself with on their
account; and when my father died I took up the business, and went
his beat, and supported my mother for the little time she lived;
and when she died I married this young woman, who was not born
upon the roads, but was a small tradesman&rsquo;s daughter, at
Gloster.&nbsp; She had a kindness for me, and, notwithstanding
her friends were against the match, she married the poor tinker,
and came to live with him upon the roads.&nbsp; Well, young man,
for six or seven years <!-- page 135--><a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>I was the
happiest fellow breathing, living just the life you described
just now&mdash;respected by everybody in this beat; when in an
evil hour comes this Black Jack, this Flaming Tinman, into these
parts, driven as they say out of Yorkshire&mdash;for no good you
may be sure.&nbsp; Now there is no beat will support two tinkers,
as you doubtless know; mine was a good one, but it would not
support the flying tinker and myself, though if it would have
supported twenty it would have been all the same to the flying
villain, who&rsquo;ll brook no one but himself; so he presently
finds me out, and offers to fight me for the beat.&nbsp; Now,
being bred upon the roads, I can fight a little, that is with
anything like my match, but I was not going to fight him, who
happens to be twice my size, and so I told him; whereupon he
knocks me down, and would have done me farther mischief had not
some men been nigh and prevented him; so he threatened to cut my
throat, and went his way.&nbsp; Well, I did not like such usage
at all, and was woundily frightened, and tried to keep as much
out of his way as possible, going anywhere but where I thought I
was likely to meet him; and sure enough for several months I
contrived to keep out of his way.&nbsp; At last somebody told me
that he was gone back to Yorkshire, whereupon I was glad at
heart, and ventured to show myself, going here and there as I did
before.&nbsp; Well, young man, it was yesterday that I and mine
set ourselves down in a lane, about five miles from here, and
lighted our fire, and had our dinner, and after dinner I sat down
to mend three kettles and a frying pan which the people in the
neighbourhood had given me to mend&mdash;for, as I told you
before, I have a good connection, owing to my <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>honesty.&nbsp; Well, as I sat there hard at work, happy
as the day&rsquo;s long, and thinking of anything but what was to
happen, who should come up but this Black Jack, this king of the
tinkers, rattling along in his cart, with his wife, that they
call Grey Moll, by his side&mdash;for the villain has got a wife,
and a maid-servant too; the last I never saw, but they that has,
says that she is as big as a house, and young, and well to look
at, which can&rsquo;t be all said of Moll, who, though
she&rsquo;s big enough in all conscience, is neither young nor
handsome.&nbsp; Well, no sooner does he see me and mine, than,
giving the reins to Grey Moll, he springs out of his cart, and
comes straight at me; not a word did he say, but on he comes
straight at me like a wild bull.&nbsp; I am a quiet man, young
fellow, but I saw now that quietness would be of no use, so I
sprang up upon my legs, and being bred upon the roads, and able
to fight a little, I squared as he came running in upon me, and
had a round or two with him.&nbsp; Lord bless you, young man, it
was like a fly fighting with an elephant&mdash;one of those big
beasts the show-folks carry about.&nbsp; I had not a chance with
the fellow, he knocked me here, he knocked me there, knocked me
into the hedge, and knocked me out again.&nbsp; I was at my last
shifts, and my poor wife saw it.&nbsp; Now my poor wife, though
she is as gentle as a pigeon, has yet a spirit of her own, and
though she wasn&rsquo;t bred upon the roads, can scratch a
little; so when she saw me at my last shifts, she flew at the
villain&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t bear to see her partner
murdered&mdash;and scratched the villain&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Lord
bless you, young man, she had better have been quiet: Grey Moll
no sooner saw what she was about, than springing out of the <!--
page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>cart, where she had sat all along perfectly quiet, save
a little whooping and screeching to encourage her
blade:&mdash;Grey Moll, I say (my flesh creeps when I think of
it&mdash;for I am a kind husband, and love my poor
wife)&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Take another draught of the ale; you look
frightened, and it will do you good.&nbsp; Stout liquor makes
stout heart, as the man says in the play.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true, young man;
here&rsquo;s to you&mdash;where was I?&nbsp; Grey Moll no sooner
saw what my wife was about, than springing out of the cart, she
flew at my poor wife, clawed off her bonnet in a moment, and
seized hold of her hair.&nbsp; Lord bless you, young man, my poor
wife, in the hands of Grey Moll, was nothing better than a pigeon
in the claws of a buzzard hawk, or I in the hands of the Flaming
Tinman, which when I saw, my heart was fit to burst, and I
determined to give up everything&mdash;everything to save my poor
wife out of Grey Moll&rsquo;s claws.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; I
shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold, both of you&mdash;Jack, Moll.&nbsp;
Hold, both of you, for God&rsquo;s sake, and I&rsquo;ll do what
you will: give up trade, and business, connection, bread, and
everything, never more travel the roads, and go down on my knees
to you in the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, this had some effect;
Moll let go my wife, and the Blazing Tinman stopped for a moment;
it was only for a moment, however, that he left off&mdash;all of
a sudden he hit me a blow which sent me against a tree; and what
did the villain then? why the flying villain seized me by the
throat, and almost throttled me, roaring&mdash;what do you think,
young man, that the flaming villain roared out?</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I really don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;something horrible, I suppose.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Horrible, indeed; you may well say
horrible, young man; neither more nor less than the
Bible&mdash;&ldquo;A Bible, a Bible!&rdquo; roared the Blazing
Tinman; and he pressed my throat so hard against the tree that my
senses began to dwaul away&mdash;a Bible, a Bible, still ringing
in my ears.&nbsp; Now, young man, my poor wife is a Christian
woman, and, though she travels the roads, carries a Bible with
her at the bottom of her sack, with which sometimes she teaches
the children to read&mdash;it was the only thing she brought with
her from the place of her kith and kin, save her own body and the
clothes on her back; so my poor wife, half distracted, runs to
her sack, pulls out the Bible, and puts it into the hand of the
Blazing Tinman, who then thrusts the end of it into my mouth with
such fury that it made my lips bleed, and broke short one of my
teeth which happened to be decayed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Swear,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;swear, you mumping villain, take your Bible oath
that you will quit and give up the beat altogether, or
I&rsquo;ll&rdquo;&mdash;and then the hard hearted villain made me
swear by the Bible, and my own damnation, half-throttled as I
was, to&mdash;to&mdash;I can&rsquo;t go on&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Take another draught&mdash;stout
liquor&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t, young man, my
heart&rsquo;s too full, and what&rsquo;s more, the pitcher is
empty.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And so he swore you, I suppose, on the
Bible, to quit the roads?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; You are right, he did so, the Gypsy
villain.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Gypsy!&nbsp; Is he a Gypsy?</p>
<p><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Not exactly; what they call a half
and half.&nbsp; His father was a Gypsy, and his mother, like
mine, one who walked the roads.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Is he of the Smiths&mdash;the
Petulengres?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; I say, young man, you know a thing or
two; one would think, to hear you talk, you had been bred upon
the roads.&nbsp; I thought none but those bred upon the roads
knew anything of that name&mdash;Petulengres!&nbsp; No, not he,
he fights the Petulengres whenever he meets them; he likes nobody
but himself, and wants to be king of the roads.&nbsp; I believe
he is a Boss, <a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"
class="citation">[139]</a> or a --- at any rate he&rsquo;s a bad
one, as I know to my cost.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And what are you going to do?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Do! you may well ask that; I don&rsquo;t
know what to do.&nbsp; My poor wife and I have been talking of
that all the morning, over that half-pint mug of beer; we
can&rsquo;t determine on what&rsquo;s to be done.&nbsp; All we
know is, that we must quit the roads.&nbsp; The villain swore
that the next time he saw us on the roads he&rsquo;d cut all our
throats, and seize our horse and bit of a cart that are now
standing out there under the tree.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And what do you mean to do with your
horse and cart?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Another question!&nbsp; What shall we do
with our cart and pony? they are of no use to us now.&nbsp; Stay
on the roads I will not, both for my oath&rsquo;s sake and my
own.&nbsp; If we had a trifle of money, we were thinking of going
to Bristol, where I might get up a little business, but we have
none; our last three farthings we spent about the mug of
beer.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; But why don&rsquo;t you sell your
horse and cart?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Sell them, and who would buy them, unless
some one who wished to set up in my line; but there&rsquo;s no
beat, and what&rsquo;s the use of the horse and cart and the few
tools without the beat?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m half inclined to buy your cart
and pony, and your beat too.</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; You!&nbsp; How came you to think of such
a thing?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why, like yourself, I hardly know what to
do.&nbsp; I want a home and work.&nbsp; As for a home, I suppose
I can contrive to make a home out of your tent and cart; and as
for work, I must learn to be a tinker, it would not be hard for
one of my trade to learn to tinker; what better can I do?&nbsp;
Would you have me go to Chester and work there now?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like the thoughts of it.&nbsp; If I go to Chester and
work there, I can&rsquo;t be my own man; I must work under a
master, and perhaps he and I should quarrel, and when I quarrel I
am apt to hit folks, and those that hit folks are sometimes sent
to prison; I don&rsquo;t like the thought either of going to
Chester or to Chester prison.&nbsp; What do you think I could
earn at Chester?</p>
<p><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; A matter of eleven shillings a week, if
anybody would employ you, which I don&rsquo;t think they would
with those hands of yours.&nbsp; But whether they would or not,
if you are of a quarrelsome nature, you must not go to Chester;
you would be in the castle in no time.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
how to advise you.&nbsp; As for selling you my stock, I&rsquo;d
see you farther first, for your own sake.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span><i>Tinker</i>.&nbsp; Why! you would get your head
knocked off.&nbsp; Suppose you were to meet him?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Pooh, don&rsquo;t be afraid on my
account; if I were to meet him I could easily manage him one way
or other.&nbsp; I know all kinds of strange words and names, and,
as I told you before, I sometimes hit people when they put me
out.</p>
<p>Here the tinker&rsquo;s wife, who for some minutes past had
been listening attentively to our discourse, interposed, saying,
in a low soft tone: &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t see, John, why
you shouldn&rsquo;t sell the young man the things, seeing that he
wishes for them, and is so confident; you have told him plainly
how matters stand, and if anything ill should befall him, people
couldn&rsquo;t lay the blame on you; but I don&rsquo;t think any
ill will befall him, and who knows but God has sent him to our
assistance in time of need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hear of no such thing,&rdquo; said the
tinker; &ldquo;I have drunk at the young man&rsquo;s expense, and
though he says he&rsquo;s quarrelsome, I would not wish to sit in
pleasanter company.&nbsp; A pretty fellow I should be, now, if I
were to let him follow his own will.&nbsp; If he once sets up on
my beat, he&rsquo;s a lost man, his ribs will be stove in, and
his head knocked off his shoulders.&nbsp; There, you are crying,
but you shan&rsquo;t have your will though; I won&rsquo;t be the
young man&rsquo;s destruction . . . If, indeed, I thought he
could manage the tinker&mdash;but he never can; he says he can
hit, but it&rsquo;s no use hitting the tinker;&mdash;crying
still! you are enough to drive one mad.&nbsp; I say, young man, I
believe you understand a thing or two; just now you were talking
of knowing hard words and names&mdash;I don&rsquo;t wish to send
you to your mischief&mdash;you say you know hard <!-- page
142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>words and names; let us see.&nbsp; Only on one
condition I&rsquo;ll sell you the pony and things; as for the
beat it&rsquo;s gone, isn&rsquo;t mine&mdash;sworn away by my own
mouth.&nbsp; Tell me what&rsquo;s my name; if you can&rsquo;t,
may I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t swear, it&rsquo;s a bad
habit, neither pleasant nor profitable.&nbsp; Your name is
Slingsby&mdash;Jack Slingsby.&nbsp; There, don&rsquo;t stare,
there&rsquo;s nothing in my telling you your name: I&rsquo;ve
been in these parts before, at least not very far from
here.&nbsp; Ten years ago, when I was little more than a child, I
was about twenty miles from here in a post chaise, at the door of
an inn, <a name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142"
class="citation">[142]</a> and as I looked from the window of the
chaise, I saw you standing by a gutter, with a big tin ladle in
your hand, and somebody called you Jack Slingsby.&nbsp; I never
forget anything I hear or see; I can&rsquo;t, I wish I
could.&nbsp; So there&rsquo;s nothing strange in my knowing your
name; indeed, there&rsquo;s nothing strange in anything, provided
you examine it to the bottom.&nbsp; Now what am I to give you for
the things?</p>
<p>I paid Slingsby five pounds ten shillings for his stock in
trade, cart, and pony&mdash;purchased sundry provisions of the
landlady, also a waggoner&rsquo;s frock, which had belonged to a
certain son of hers, deceased, gave my little animal a feed of
corn, and prepared to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, young man,&rdquo; said Slingsby, shaking
me by the hand, &ldquo;you are the best friend I&rsquo;ve had for
many a day: I have but one thing to tell you, Don&rsquo;t cross
that fellow&rsquo;s path if you can help it; and
stay&mdash;should the pony refuse to go, just touch him so, and
he&rsquo;ll fly like the wind.&rdquo;</p>

Bushes&mdash;Housekeeping&mdash;Sticks and Furze&mdash;The

Bellows&mdash;Twenty Years.</p>
<p>It was two or three hours past noon when I took my departure
from the place of the last adventure, walking by the side of my
little cart; the pony, invigorated by the corn, to which he was
probably not much accustomed, proceeded right gallantly; so far
from having to hasten him forward by the particular application
which the tinker had pointed out to me, I had rather to repress
his eagerness, being, though an excellent pedestrian, not
unfrequently left behind.&nbsp; The country through which I
passed was beautiful and interesting, but solitary: few
habitations appeared.&nbsp; As it was quite a matter of
indifference to me in what direction I went, the whole world
being before me, I allowed the pony to decide upon the matter; it
was not long before he left the high road, being probably no
friend to public places.&nbsp; I followed him I knew not whither,
but, from subsequent observation, have reason to suppose that our
course was in a north-west direction.&nbsp; At length night came
upon us, and a cold wind sprang up, which was succeeded by a
drizzling rain.</p>
<p><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>I had originally intended to pass the night in the
cart, or to pitch my little tent on some convenient spot by the
road&rsquo;s side; but, owing to the alteration in the weather, I
thought that it would be advisable to take up my quarters in any
hedge alehouse at which I might arrive.&nbsp; To tell the truth,
I was not very sorry to have an excuse to pass the night once
more beneath a roof.&nbsp; I had determined to live quite
independent, but I had never before passed a night by myself
abroad, and felt a little apprehensive at the idea; I hoped,
however, on the morrow, to be a little more prepared for the
step, so I determined for one night&mdash;only for one night
longer&mdash;to sleep like a Christian; but human determinations
are not always put into effect, such a thing as opportunity is
frequently wanting, such was the case here.&nbsp; I went on for a
considerable time, in expectation of coming to some rustic
hostelry, but nothing of the kind presented itself to my eyes;
the country in which I now was seemed almost uninhabited, not a
house of any kind was to be seen&mdash;at least I saw
none&mdash;though it is true houses might be near without my
seeing them, owing to the darkness of the night, for neither moon
nor star was abroad.&nbsp; I heard, occasionally, the bark of
dogs; but the sound appeared to come from an immense
distance.&nbsp; The rain still fell, and the ground beneath my
feet was wet and miry; in short, it was a night in which even a
tramper by profession would feel more comfortable in being housed
than abroad.&nbsp; I followed in the rear of the cart, the pony
still proceeding at a sturdy pace, till methought I heard other
hoofs than those of my own nag; I listened for a moment, and
distinctly heard the sound of hoofs approaching at a great <!--
page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>rate, and evidently from the quarter towards which I
and my little caravan were moving.&nbsp; We were in a dark
lane&mdash;so dark that it was impossible for me to see my own
hand.&nbsp; Apprehensive that some accident might occur, I ran
forward, and, seizing the pony by the bridle, drew him as near as
I could to the hedge.&nbsp; On came the hoofs&mdash;trot, trot,
trot; and evidently more than those of one horse; their speed as
they advanced appeared to slacken&mdash;it was only, however, for
a moment.&nbsp; I heard a voice cry, &ldquo;Push on,&mdash;this
is a desperate robbing place,&mdash;never mind the dark;&rdquo;
and the hoofs came on quicker than before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said I, at the top of my voice; &ldquo;stop!
or . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; Before I could finish what I was about to
say there was a stumble, a heavy fall, a cry, and a groan, and
putting out my foot I felt what I conjectured to be the head of a
horse stretched upon the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord have mercy upon
us! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; exclaimed a voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Spare my life,&rdquo; cried another voice, apparently from
the ground; &ldquo;only spare my life, and take all I
have!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you, Master Wise?&rdquo;
cried the other voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help! here, Master
Bat,&rdquo; cried the voice from the ground, &ldquo;help me up or
I shall be murdered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; said Bat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some one has knocked me
down, and is robbing me,&rdquo; said the voice from the
ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help! murder!&rdquo; cried Bat; and,
regardless of the entreaties of the man on the ground that he
would stay and help him up, he urged his horse forward and
galloped away as fast as he could.&nbsp; I remained for some time
quiet, listening to various groans and exclamations uttered by
the person on the ground; at length I said, &ldquo;Holloa! are
you hurt?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Spare <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>my life,
and take all I have!&rdquo; said the voice from the ground.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have they not done robbing you yet?&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;when they have finished let me know, and I will come and
help you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; said the voice;
&ldquo;pray come and help me, and do me no mischief.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You were saying that some one was robbing you,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think I shall come till he is gone
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you ben&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said
the voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you robbed?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I be,&rdquo; said the voice;
&ldquo;not yet at any rate; but who are you?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A traveller whom you and your
partner were going to run over in this dark lane; you almost
frightened me out of my senses.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Frightened!&rdquo; said the voice, in a louder tone;
&ldquo;frightened! oh!&rdquo; and thereupon I heard somebody
getting upon his legs.&nbsp; This accomplished, the individual
proceeded to attend to his horse, and with a little difficulty
raised him upon his legs also.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
you hurt?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurt!&rdquo; said the
voice; &ldquo;not I; don&rsquo;t think it, whatever the horse may
be.&nbsp; I tell you what, my fellow, I thought you were a
robber; and now I find you are not, I have a good
mind&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To do what?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To serve you out; ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you
ashamed&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;At what?&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;not to have robbed you?&nbsp; Shall I set about it
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said the man, dropping
the bullying tone which he had assumed; &ldquo;you are
joking&mdash;robbing! who talks of robbing?&nbsp; I wonder how my
horse&rsquo;s knees are; not much hurt, I think&mdash;only
mired.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man, whoever he was, then got upon his
horse; and, after moving him about a little, said, &ldquo;Good
night, friend; where are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Here I
am,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;just behind you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are, are you?&nbsp; Take <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>that.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know not what he did, but probably
pricking his horse with the spur the animal kicked out violently;
one of his heels struck me on the shoulder, but luckily missed my
face; I fell back with the violence of the blow, whilst the
fellow scampered off at a great rate.&nbsp; Stopping at some
distance, he loaded me with abuse, and then, continuing his way
at a rapid trot, I heard no more of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a difference!&rdquo; said I, getting up;
&ldquo;last night I was f&ecirc;ted in the hall of a rich genius,
and to-night I am knocked down and mired in a dark lane by the
heel of Master Wise&rsquo;s horse&mdash;I wonder who gave him
that name?&nbsp; And yet he was wise enough to wreak his revenge
upon me, and I was not wise enough to keep out of his way.&nbsp;
Well, I am not much hurt, so it is of little
consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now bethought me that, as I had a carriage of my own, I
might as well make use of it; I therefore got into the cart, and,
taking the reins in my hand, gave an encouraging cry to the pony,
whereupon the sturdy little animal started again at as brisk a
pace as if he had not already come many a long mile.&nbsp; I lay
half reclining in the cart, holding the reins lazily, and
allowing the animal to go just where he pleased, often wondering
where he would conduct me.&nbsp; At length I felt drowsy, and my
head sank upon my breast; I soon aroused myself, but it was only
to doze again; this occurred several times.&nbsp; Opening my eyes
after a doze somewhat longer than the others, I found that the
drizzling rain had ceased, a corner of the moon was apparent in
the heavens, casting a faint light; I looked around for a moment
or two, but my eyes <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>and brain were heavy with slumber,
and I could scarcely distinguish where we were.&nbsp; I had a
kind of dim consciousness that we were traversing an unenclosed
country&mdash;perhaps a heath; I thought, however, that I saw
certain large black objects looming in the distance, which I had
a confused idea might be woods or plantations; the pony still
moved at his usual pace.&nbsp; I did not find the jolting of the
cart at all disagreeable, on the contrary, it had quite a
somniferous effect upon me.&nbsp; Again my eyes closed; I opened
them once more, but with less perception in them than before,
looked forward, and, muttering something about woodlands, I
placed myself in an easier posture than I had hitherto done, and
fairly fell asleep.</p>
<p>How long I continued in that state I am unable to say, but I
believe for a considerable time; I was suddenly awakened by the
ceasing of the jolting to which I had become accustomed, and of
which I was perfectly sensible in my sleep.&nbsp; I started up
and looked around me, the moon was still shining, and the face of
the heaven was studded with stars; I found myself amidst a maze
of bushes of various kinds, but principally hazel and holly,
through which was a path or drift-way with grass growing on
either side, upon which the pony was already diligently
browsing.&nbsp; I conjectured that this place had been one of the
haunts of his former master, and, on dismounting and looking
about, was strengthened in that opinion by finding a spot under
an ash tree which, from its burnt and blackened appearance,
seemed to have been frequently used as a fireplace.&nbsp; I will
take up my quarters here, thought I; it is an excellent spot for
me to commence my new profession in; I was quite right to trust
myself to the <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>guidance of the pony.&nbsp;
Unharnessing the animal without delay, I permitted him to browse
at free will on the grass, convinced that he would not wander far
from a place to which he was so much attached; I then pitched the
little tent close beside the ash tree to which I have alluded,
and conveyed two or three articles into it, and instantly felt
that I had commenced housekeeping for the first time in my
life.&nbsp; Housekeeping, however, without a fire is a very sorry
affair, something like the housekeeping of children in their toy
houses; of this I was the more sensible from feeling very cold
and shivering, owing to my late exposure to the rain, and
sleeping in the night air.&nbsp; Collecting, therefore, all the
dry sticks and furze I could find, I placed them upon the
fireplace, adding certain chips and a billet which I found in the
cart, it having apparently been the habit of Slingsby to carry
with him a small store of fuel.&nbsp; Having then struck a spark
in a tinder-box and lighted a match, I set fire to the
combustible heap, and was not slow in raising a cheerful blaze; I
then drew my cart near the fire, and, seating myself on one of
the shafts, hung over the warmth with feelings of intense
pleasure and satisfaction.&nbsp; Having continued in this posture
for a considerable time, I turned my eyes to the heaven in the
direction of a particular star; I, however, could not find the
star, nor indeed many of the starry train, the greater number
having fled, from which circumstance, and from the appearance of
the sky, I concluded that morning was nigh.&nbsp; About this time
I again began to feel drowsy; I therefore arose, and having
prepared for myself a kind of couch in the tent, I flung myself
upon it and went to sleep.</p>
<p><!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>I will not say that I was awakened in the morning by
the carolling of birds, as I perhaps might if I were writing a
novel; I awoke because, to use vulgar language, I had slept my
sleep out, not because the birds were carolling around me in
numbers, as they had probably been for hours without my hearing
them.&nbsp; I got up and left my tent; the morning was yet more
bright than that of the preceding day.&nbsp; Impelled by
curiosity, I walked about endeavouring to ascertain to what place
chance, or rather the pony, had brought me; following the
drift-way for some time, amidst bushes and stunted trees, I came
to a grove of dark pines, through which it appeared to lead; I
tracked it a few hundred yards, but seeing nothing but trees, and
the way being wet and sloughy, owing to the recent rain, I
returned on my steps, and, pursuing the path in another
direction, came to a sandy road leading over a common, doubtless
the one I had traversed the preceding night.&nbsp; My curiosity
satisfied, I returned to my little encampment, and on the way
beheld a small footpath on the left winding through the bushes,
which had before escaped my observation.&nbsp; Having reached my
tent and cart, I breakfasted on some of the provisions which I
had procured the day before, and then proceeded to take a regular
account of the stock formerly possessed by Slingsby the tinker,
but now become my own by right of lawful purchase.</p>
<p>Besides the pony, the cart, and the tent, I found I was
possessed of a mattress stuffed with straw on which to lie, and a
blanket to cover me, the last quite clean and nearly new; then
there was a frying pan and a kettle, the first for cooking any
food which required cooking, and the second for <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>heating any water which I might wish to heat.&nbsp; I
likewise found an earthen teapot and two or three cups; of the
first I should rather say I found the remains, it being broken in
three parts, no doubt since it came into my possession, which
would have precluded the possibility of my asking anybody to tea
for the present, should anybody visit me, even supposing I had
tea and sugar, which was not the case.&nbsp; I then overhauled
what might more strictly be called the stock in trade; this
consisted of various tools, an iron ladle, a chafing pan and
small bellows, sundry pans and kettles, the latter being of tin,
with the exception of one which was of copper, all in a state of
considerable dilapidation&mdash;if I may use the term; of these
first Slingsby had spoken in particular, advising me to mend them
as soon as possible, and to endeavour to sell them, in order that
I might have the satisfaction of receiving some return upon the
outlay which I had made.&nbsp; There was likewise a small
quantity of block tin, sheet tin, and solder.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
Slingsby,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is certainly a very honest man,
he has sold me more than my money&rsquo;s worth; I believe,
however, there is something more in the cart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon I rummaged the farther end of the cart, and, amidst a
quantity of straw, I found a small anvil and bellows of that kind
which are used in forges, and two hammers such as smiths use, one
great, and the other small.</p>
<p>The sight of these last articles caused me no little surprise,
as no word which had escaped from the mouth of Slingsby had given
me reason to suppose that he had ever followed the occupation of
a smith; yet, if he had not, how did he come by them?&nbsp; I sat
down upon the shaft, and pondered <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>the
question deliberately in my mind; at length I concluded that he
had come by them by one of those numerous casualties which occur
upon the roads, of which I, being a young hand upon the roads,
must have a very imperfect conception; honestly, of
course&mdash;for I scouted the idea that Slingsby would have
stolen this blacksmith&rsquo;s gear&mdash;for I had the highest
opinion of his honesty, which opinion I still retain at the
present day, which is upwards of twenty years from the time of
which I am speaking, during the whole of which period I have
neither seen the poor fellow, nor received any intelligence of
him.</p>

<p>I passed the greater part of the day in endeavouring to teach
myself the mysteries of my new profession.&nbsp; I cannot say
that I was very successful, but the time passed agreeably, and
was therefore not ill spent.&nbsp; Towards evening I flung my
work aside, took some refreshment, and afterwards a walk.</p>
<p>This time I turned up the small footpath, of which I have
already spoken.&nbsp; It led in a zigzag manner through thickets
of hazel, elder, and sweet briar; after following its windings
for somewhat better than a furlong, I heard a gentle sound of
water, and presently came to a small rill, which ran directly
across the path.&nbsp; I was rejoiced at the sight, for I had
already experienced the want of water, which I yet knew must be
nigh at hand, as I was in a place to all appearance occasionally
frequented by wandering people, who I was aware never take up
their quarters in places where water is difficult to be
obtained.&nbsp; Forthwith I stretched myself on the ground, and
took a long and delicious <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>draught of
the crystal stream, and then, seating myself in a bush, I
continued for some time gazing on the water as it purled tinkling
away in its channel through an opening in the hazels, and should
have probably continued much longer had not the thought that I
had left my property unprotected compelled me to rise and return
to my encampment.</p>
<p>Night came on, and a beautiful night it was; up rose the moon,
and innumerable stars decked the firmament of heaven.&nbsp; I sat
on the shaft, my eyes turned upwards.&nbsp; I had found it: there
it was twinkling millions of miles above me, mightiest star of
the system to which we belong: of all stars, the one which has
most interest for me&mdash;the star Jupiter.</p>
<p>Why have I always taken an interest in thee, O Jupiter?&nbsp;
I know nothing about thee, save what every child knows, that thou
art a big star, whose only light is derived from moons.&nbsp; And
is not that knowledge enough to make me feel an interest in
thee?&nbsp; Ay, truly, I never look at thee without wondering
what is going on in thee; what is life in Jupiter?&nbsp; That
there is life in Jupiter who can doubt?&nbsp; There is life in
our own little star, therefore there must be life in Jupiter,
which is not a little star.&nbsp; But how different must life be
in Jupiter from what it is in our own little star!&nbsp; Life
here is life beneath the dear sun&mdash;life in Jupiter is life
beneath moons&mdash;four moons&mdash;no single moon is able to
illumine that vast bulk.&nbsp; All know what life is in our own
little star; it is anything but a routine of happiness here,
where the dear sun rises to us every day: then how sad and moping
must life be in mighty Jupiter, on which <!-- page 155--><a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>no sun ever
shines, and which is never lighted save by pale moon-beams!&nbsp;
The thought that there is more sadness and melancholy in Jupiter
than in this world of ours, where, alas! there is but too much,
has always made me take a melancholy interest in that huge
distant star.</p>
<p>Two or three days passed by in much the same manner as the
first.&nbsp; During the morning I worked upon my kettles, and
employed the remaining part of the day as I best could.&nbsp; The
whole of this time I only saw two individuals, rustics, who
passed by my encampment without vouchsafing me a glance; they
probably considered themselves my superiors, as perhaps they
were.</p>
<p>One very brilliant morning, as I sat at work in very good
spirits, for by this time I had actually mended in a very
creditable way, as I imagined, two kettles and a frying pan, I
heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the path leading to
the rivulet; at first it sounded from a considerable distance,
but drew nearer by degrees.&nbsp; I soon remarked that the tones
were exceedingly sharp and shrill, with yet something of
childhood in them.&nbsp; Once or twice I distinguished certain
words in the song which the voice was singing; the words
were&mdash;but no, I thought again I was probably
mistaken&mdash;and then the voice ceased for a time; presently I
heard it again, close to the entrance of the footpath; in another
moment I heard it in the lane or glade in which stood my tent,
where it abruptly stopped, but not before I had heard the very
words which I at first thought I had distinguished.</p>
<p>I turned my head; at the entrance of the footpath, which might
be about thirty yards from the place where I was sitting, I
perceived the figure <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>of a young girl; her face was turned
towards me, and she appeared to be scanning me and my encampment;
after a little time she looked in the other direction, only for a
moment, however; probably observing nothing in that quarter, she
again looked towards me, and almost immediately stepped forward;
and, as she advanced, sang the song which I had heard in the
wood, the first words of which were those which I have already
alluded to.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rommany chi<br />
And the Rommany chal<br />
Shall jaw tasaulor<br />
To drab the bawlor<br />
And dook the gry<br />
Of the farming rye.&rdquo; <a name="citation156"></a><a
href="#footnote156" class="citation">[156]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very pretty song, thought I, falling again hard to work upon
my kettle; a very pretty song, which bodes the farmers much
good.&nbsp; Let them look to their cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All alone here, brother?&rdquo; said a voice close by
me, in sharp but not disagreeable tones.</p>
<p>I made no answer, but continued my work, click, click, with
the gravity which became one of my profession.&nbsp; I allowed at
least half a minute to elapse before I even lifted up my
eyes.</p>
<p>A girl of about thirteen was standing before me; her features
were very pretty, but with a peculiar expression; her complexion
was a clear olive, and her jet black hair hung back upon her
shoulders.&nbsp; <!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>She was rather scantily dressed, and
her arms and feet were bare; round her neck, however, was a
handsome string of corals, with ornaments of gold; in her hand
she held a bulrush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All alone here, brother?&rdquo; said the girl, as I
looked up; &ldquo;all alone here, in the lane; where are your
wife and children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me brother?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am
no brother of yours.&nbsp; Do you take me for one of your
people?&nbsp; I am no Gypsy; not I, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, brother, you are no
Roman&mdash;Roman, indeed! you are not handsome enough to be a
Roman; not black enough, tinker though you be.&nbsp; If I called
you brother, it was because I didn&rsquo;t know what else to call
you.&nbsp; Marry, come up, brother, I should be sorry to have you
for a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither like you, nor dislike you, brother; what will
you have for that kekaubi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of talking to me in that
un-Christian way; what do you mean, young gentlewoman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, brother, what a fool you are! every tinker knows
what a kekaubi is.&nbsp; I was asking you what you would have for
that kettle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-and-sixpence, young gentlewoman; isn&rsquo;t it
well mended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well mended!&nbsp; I could have done it better myself;
three-and-sixpence! it&rsquo;s only fit to be played at football
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take no less for it, young gentlewoman; it has
caused me a world of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a worse mended kettle.&nbsp; I say,
brother, your hair is white.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nature; your hair is black; nature,
nothing but nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am young, brother; my hair is
black&mdash;that&rsquo;s nature: you are young, brother; your
hair is white&mdash;that&rsquo;s not nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it if it be not, but it is nature
after all; did you never see grey hair on the young?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&nbsp; I have heard it is true of a grey lad, and
a bad one he was.&nbsp; Oh, so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down on the grass, and tell me all about it,
sister; do to oblige me, pretty sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, brother, you don&rsquo;t speak as you
did&mdash;you don&rsquo;t speak like a Gorgio, you speak like one
of us, you call me sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you call me brother; I am not an uncivil person
after all, sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother, tell me one thing, and look me in the
face&mdash;there&mdash;do you speak Rommany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rommany!&nbsp; Rommany! what is Rommany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Rommany? our language to be sure; tell me,
brother, only one thing, you don&rsquo;t speak
Rommany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it, I wish to know.&nbsp; Do you
speak Rommany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean thieves&rsquo; slang&mdash;cant? no, I
don&rsquo;t speak cant, I don&rsquo;t like it, I only know a few
words; they call a sixpence a tanner, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the girl, sitting down
on the ground, &ldquo;I was almost thinking&mdash;well, never
mind, you don&rsquo;t know Rommany.&nbsp; I say, brother, I think
I should like to have the kekaubi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said it was badly mended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, brother, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&ldquo;I thought you said it was only fit to be played
at football with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, brother, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you give for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, I am the poor person&rsquo;s child, I will
give you sixpence for the kekaubi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor person&rsquo;s child; how came you by that
necklace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be civil, brother; am I to have the kekaubi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for sixpence; isn&rsquo;t the kettle nicely
mended?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a nicer mended kettle, brother; am I to
have the kekaubi, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like me then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike you&mdash;I dislike no one;
there&rsquo;s only one, and him I don&rsquo;t dislike, him I
hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know, I never saw him, but &rsquo;tis no
affair of yours, you don&rsquo;t speak Rommany; you will let me
have the kekaubi, pretty brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have it, but not for sixpence, I&rsquo;ll give
it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parraco tute, that is, I thank you, brother; the
rikkeni [pretty] kekaubi is now mine.&nbsp; Oh, rare!&nbsp; I
thank you kindly, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Starting up, she flung the bulrush aside which she had
hitherto held in her hand, and, seizing the kettle, she looked at
it for a moment, and then began a kind of dance, flourishing the
kettle over her head the while, and singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rommany chi<br />
And the Rommany chal<br />
Shall jaw tasaulor<br />
To drab the bawlor<br />
And dook the gry<br />
Of the farming rye.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;Good bye, brother, I must be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, sister; why do you sing that wicked
song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wicked song, hey, brother! you don&rsquo;t understand
the song!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! Gypsy daughter,&rdquo; said I, starting up and
clapping my hands, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand Rommany,
don&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; You shall see; here&rsquo;s the answer to
your gillie&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Rommany chi<br />
And the Rommany chal<br />
Love luripen<br />

And hokkeripen,<br />
And every pen<br />
But lachipen<br />
And tatchipen.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation160"></a><a
href="#footnote160" class="citation">[160]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The girl, who had given a slight start when I began, remained
for some time after I had concluded the song, standing motionless
as a statue, with the kettle in her hand.&nbsp; At length she
came towards me, and stared me full in the face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Grey, tall, and talks Rommany,&rdquo; said she to
herself.&nbsp; In her countenance there was an expression which I
had not seen before&mdash;an expression which struck me as being
composed of fear, curiosity, and the deepest hate.&nbsp; It was
momentary, however, and was succeeded by one smiling, frank, and
open.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, ha, brother,&rdquo; <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>said she,
&ldquo;well, I like you all the better for talking Rommany; it is
a sweet language, isn&rsquo;t it? especially as you sing
it.&nbsp; How did you pick it up?&nbsp; But you picked it up upon
the roads, no doubt?&nbsp; Ha, it was funny in you to pretend not
to know it, and you so flush with it all the time; it was not
kind in you, however, to frighten the poor person&rsquo;s child
so by screaming out, but it was kind in you to give the rikkeni
kekaubi to the child of the poor person.&nbsp; She will be
grateful to you; she will bring you her little dog to show you,
her pretty juggal; <a name="citation161"></a><a
href="#footnote161" class="citation">[161]</a> the poor
person&rsquo;s child will come and see you again; you are not
going away to-day, I hope, or to-morrow, pretty brother,
grey-haired brother&mdash;you are not going away to-morrow, I
hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor the next day,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;only to take a
stroll to see if I can sell a kettle; good bye, little sister,
Rommany sister, dingy sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, tall brother,&rdquo; said the girl, as she
departed, singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rommany chi,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about that girl that I
don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said I to myself; &ldquo;something
mysterious.&nbsp; However, it is nothing to me, she knows not who
I am, and if she did, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late that evening as I sat on the shaft of my cart in deep
meditation, with my arms folded, I thought I heard a rustling in
the bushes over against me.&nbsp; I turned my eyes in that
direction, but saw nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some bird,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;an owl, perhaps;&rdquo; and once more I fell into
meditation; my mind wandered from one thing to <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>another&mdash;musing now on the structure of the Roman
tongue&mdash;now on the rise and fall of the Persian
power&mdash;and now on the powers vested in recorders at quarter
sessions.&nbsp; I was thinking what a fine thing it must be to be
a recorder of the peace, when, lifting up my eyes, I saw right
opposite, not a culprit at the bar, but, staring at me through a
gap in the bush, a face wild and strange, half covered with grey
hair; I only saw it a moment, the next it had disappeared.</p>

<p>The next day, at an early hour, I harnessed my little pony,
and, putting my things in my cart, I went on my projected
stroll.&nbsp; Crossing the moor, I arrived in about an hour at a
small village, from which, after a short stay, I proceeded to
another, and from thence to a third.&nbsp; I found that the name
of Slingsby was well known in these parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are a friend of Slingsby you must be an honest
lad,&rdquo; said an ancient crone; &ldquo;you shall never want
for work whilst I can give it you.&nbsp; Here, take my kettle,
the bottom came out this morning, and lend me that of yours till
you bring it back.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not afraid to trust
you&mdash;not I.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t hurry yourself, young man; if
you don&rsquo;t come back for a fortnight I shan&rsquo;t have the
worse opinion of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I returned to my quarters at evening, tired, but rejoiced at
heart; I had work before me for several <!-- page 164--><a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>days,
having collected various kekaubies which required mending, in
place of those which I left behind&mdash;those which I had been
employed upon during the last few days.&nbsp; I found all quiet
in the lane or glade, and, unharnessing my little horse, I once
more pitched my tent in the old spot beneath the ash, lighted my
fire, ate my frugal meal, and then, after looking for some time
at the heavenly bodies, and more particularly at the star
Jupiter, I entered my tent, lay down upon my pallet, and went to
sleep.</p>
<p>Nothing occurred on the following day which requires any
particular notice, nor indeed on the one succeeding that.&nbsp;
It was about noon on the third day that I sat beneath the shade
of the ash tree; I was not at work, for the weather was
particularly hot, and I felt but little inclination to make any
exertion.&nbsp; Leaning my back against the tree, I was not long
in falling into a slumber; I particularly remember that slumber
of mine beneath the ash tree, for it was about the sweetest
slumber that I ever enjoyed; how long I continued in it I do not
know; I could almost have wished that it had lasted to the
present time.&nbsp; All of a sudden it appeared to me that a
voice cried in my ear, &ldquo;Danger! danger!
danger!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing seemingly could be more distinct
than the words which I heard; then an uneasy sensation came over
me, which I strove to get rid of, and at last succeeded, for I
awoke.&nbsp; The Gypsy girl was standing just opposite to me,
with her eyes fixed upon my countenance; a singular kind of
little dog stood beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;was it you that cried
danger?&nbsp; What danger is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>&ldquo;Danger, brother? there is no danger; what danger
should there be?&nbsp; I called to my little dog, but that was in
the wood; my little dog&rsquo;s name is not danger, but stranger;
what danger should there be, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, indeed, except in sleeping beneath a tree; what
is that you have got in your hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something for you,&rdquo; said the girl, sitting down
and proceeding to untie a white napkin; &ldquo;a pretty manricli,
so sweet, so nice; when I went home to my people I told my
grandbebee how kind you had been to the poor person&rsquo;s
child, and when my grandbebee saw the kekaubi, she said,
&lsquo;Hir mi devlis, <a name="citation165a"></a><a
href="#footnote165a" class="citation">[165a]</a> it won&rsquo;t
do for the poor people to be ungrateful; by my God, I will bake a
cake for the young harko mescro.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation165b"></a><a href="#footnote165b"
class="citation">[165b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are two cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, two cakes, both for you; my grandbebee
meant them both for you&mdash;but list, brother, I will have one
of them for bringing them.&nbsp; I know you will give me one,
pretty brother, grey-haired brother&mdash;which shall I have,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the napkin were two round cakes, seemingly made of rich and
costly compounds, and precisely similar in form, each weighing
about half a pound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which shall I have, brother?&rdquo; said the Gypsy
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whichever you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother, no, the cakes are yours, not mine, it is
for you to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, give me the one nearest you, and take the
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, yes,&rdquo; said the girl; and taking
<!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>the cakes, she flung them into the air two or three
times, catching them as they fell, and singing the while.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pretty brother, grey-haired brother&mdash;here,
brother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;here is your cake, this other is
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; said I, taking the cake,
&ldquo;that this is the one I chose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, brother; but if you like you can have mine;
there&rsquo;s no difference, however&mdash;shall I
eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sister, eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, brother, I do; now, brother, eat, pretty brother,
grey-haired brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not hungry! well, what then&mdash;what has being hungry
to do with the matter?&nbsp; It is my grandbebee&rsquo;s cake
which was sent because you were kind to the poor person&rsquo;s
child; eat, brother, eat, and we shall be like the children in
the wood that the Gorgios speak of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children in the wood had nothing to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they had hips and haws; we have better.&nbsp; Eat,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, sister, I do,&rdquo; and I ate a piece of the
cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, how do you like it?&rdquo; said the
girl, looking fixedly at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very rich and sweet, and yet there is something
strange about it; I don&rsquo;t think I shall eat any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fie, brother, fie, to find fault with the poor
person&rsquo;s cake; see, I have nearly eaten mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty little dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not, brother? that&rsquo;s my juggal, my little
sister, as I call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>&ldquo;Come here, juggal,&rdquo; said I to the
animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with my juggal?&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to give her a piece of cake,&rdquo; said I,
offering the dog a piece which I had just broken off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said the girl, snatching the
dog away; &ldquo;my grandbebee&rsquo;s cake is not for
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I just now saw you give the animal a piece of
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie, brother, you saw no such thing; but I see how
it is, you wish to affront the poor person&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; I
shall go to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep still, and don&rsquo;t be angry; see, I have eaten
the piece which I offered the dog.&nbsp; I meant no
offence.&nbsp; It is a sweet cake after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it, brother?&nbsp; I am glad you like
it.&nbsp; Offence! brother, no offence at all!&nbsp; I am so glad
you like my grandbebee&rsquo;s cake, but she will be wanting me
at home.&nbsp; Eat one piece more of grandbebee&rsquo;s <a
name="citation167"></a><a href="#footnote167"
class="citation">[167]</a> cake and I will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not hungry, I will put the rest by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One piece more before I go, handsome brother,
grey-haired brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not eat any more, I have already eaten more than
I wished to oblige you; if you must go, good day to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose upon her feet, looked hard at me, then at the
remainder of the cake which I held in my hand, and then at me
again, and then stood for a moment or two, as if in deep thought;
presently an air of satisfaction came over her countenance, she
smiled and said, &ldquo;Well, brother, well, do as you please, I
merely wished you to eat because you <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>have been
so kind to the poor person&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; She loves you so,
that she could have wished to have seen you eat it all; good bye,
brother, I dare say when I am gone you will eat some more of it,
and if you don&rsquo;t, I dare say you have eaten enough
to&mdash;to&mdash;show your love for us.&nbsp; After all, it was
a poor person&rsquo;s cake, a Rommany manricli, <a
name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a> and all you Gorgios are somewhat
gorgious.&nbsp; Farewell, brother, pretty brother, grey-haired
brother.&nbsp; Come, juggal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remained under the ash tree seated on the grass for a minute
or two, and endeavoured to resume the occupation in which I had
been engaged before I fell asleep, but I felt no inclination for
labour.&nbsp; I then thought I would sleep again, and once more
reclined against the tree, and slumbered for some little time,
but my sleep was more agitated than before.&nbsp; Something
appeared to bear heavy on my breast, I struggled in my sleep,
fell on the grass, and awoke; my temples were throbbing, there
was a burning in my eyes, and my mouth felt parched; the
oppression about the chest which I had felt in my sleep still
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must shake off these feelings,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and get upon my legs.&rdquo;&nbsp; I walked
rapidly up and down upon the green sward; at length, feeling my
thirst increase, I directed my steps down the narrow path to the
spring which ran amidst the bushes; arriving there, I knelt down
and drank of the water, but on lifting up my head I felt
thirstier than before; again I drank, but with the like result; I
was about to drink for the third time, when I felt a dreadful
qualm which instantly robbed me of nearly all my strength.&nbsp;
What can be the matter with me, <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>thought I;
but I suppose I have made myself ill by drinking cold
water.&nbsp; I got up and made the best of my way back to my
tent; before I reached it the qualm had seized me again, and I
was deadly sick.&nbsp; I flung myself on my pallet, qualm
succeeded qualm, but in the intervals my mouth was dry and
burning, and I felt a frantic desire to drink, but no water was
at hand, and to reach the spring once more was impossible; the
qualms continued, deadly pains shot through my whole frame; I
could bear my agonies no longer, and I fell into a trance or
swoon.&nbsp; How long I continued therein I know not; on
recovering, however, I felt somewhat better, and attempted to
lift my head off my couch; the next moment, however, the qualms
and pains returned, if possible, with greater violence than
before.&nbsp; I am dying, thought I, like a dog, without any
help; and then methought I heard a sound at a distance like
people singing, and then once more I relapsed into my swoon.</p>
<p>I revived just as a heavy blow sounded upon the canvas of the
tent.&nbsp; I started, but my condition did not permit me to
rise; again the same kind of blow sounded upon the canvas; I
thought for a moment of crying out and requesting assistance, but
an inexplicable something chained my tongue, and now I heard a
whisper on the outside of the tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;He does not
move, bebee,&rdquo; said a voice which I knew.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should not wonder if it has done for him already; however, strike
again with your ran;&rdquo; <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a> and then there was
another blow, after which another voice cried aloud in a strange
tone, &ldquo;Is the gentleman of the house asleep, or is he
taking his dinner?&rdquo;&nbsp; I remained quite silent and <!--
page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>motionless, and in another moment the voice continued,
&ldquo;What, no answer? what can the gentleman of the house be
about that he makes no answer? perhaps the gentleman of the house
may be darning his stockings?&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon a face
peered into the door of the tent, at the farther extremity of
which I was stretched.&nbsp; It was that of a woman, but owing to
the posture in which she stood, with her back to the light, and
partly owing to a large straw bonnet, I could distinguish but
very little of the features of her countenance.&nbsp; I had,
however, recognised her voice; it was that of my old
acquaintance, Mrs. Herne.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho, ho, sir!&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;here you are.&nbsp; Come here, Leonora,&rdquo; said
she to the Gypsy girl, who pressed in at the other side of the
door; &ldquo;here is the gentleman, not asleep, but only
stretched out after dinner.&nbsp; Sit down on your ham, child, at
the door, I shall do the same.&nbsp; There&mdash;you have seen me
before, sir, have you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman makes no answer, bebee; perhaps he does
not know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known him of old, Leonora,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Herne; &ldquo;and, to tell you the truth, though I spoke to him
just now, I expected no answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way he has, bebee, <a
name="citation170"></a><a href="#footnote170"
class="citation">[170]</a> I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child, it&rsquo;s a way he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your bonnet, bebee, perhaps he cannot see your
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think that will be of much use, child;
however, I will take off my bonnet&mdash;there&mdash;and shake
out my hair&mdash;there&mdash;you have seen this hair before,
sir, and this face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No answer, bebee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;Though the one was not quite so grey, nor the
other so wrinkled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came they so, bebee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All along of this Gorgio, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman in the house you mean, bebee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child, the gentleman in the house.&nbsp; God grant
that I may preserve my temper.&nbsp; Do you know, sir, my
name?&nbsp; My name is Herne, which signifies a hairy individual,
though neither grey-haired nor wrinkled.&nbsp; It is not the
nature of the Hernes to be grey or wrinkled, even when they are
old, and I am not old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, bebee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty-five years, child&mdash;an inconsiderable
number.&nbsp; My mother was a hundred and one&mdash;a
considerable age&mdash;when she died, yet she had not one grey
hair, and not more than six wrinkles&mdash;an inconsiderable
number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had no griefs, bebee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty, child, but not like mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so hard to bear, bebee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child, my head wanders when I think of them.&nbsp;
After the death of my husband, who came to his end untimeously, I
went to live with a daughter of mine, married out among certain
Romans who walk about the eastern counties, and with whom for
some time I found a home and pleasant society, for they lived
right Romanly, which gave my heart considerable satisfaction, who
am a Roman born, and hope to die so.&nbsp; When I say right
Romanly, I mean that they kept to themselves, and were not much
given to blabbing about their private matters in promiscuous
company.&nbsp; Well, things went on in this way for some time,
<!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>when one day my son-in-law brings home a young Gorgio
of singular and outrageous ugliness, and, without much preamble,
says to me and mine, &lsquo;This is my pal, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t he
a beauty? fall down and worship him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hold,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I for one will never consent
to such foolishness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was right, bebee, I think I should have done the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you would, child; but what was the profit of
it?&nbsp; The whole party makes an almighty of this Gorgio, lets
him into their ways, says prayers of his making, till things come
to such a pass that my own daughter says to me, &lsquo;I shall
buy myself a veil and fan, and treat myself to a play and
sacrament.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says I; says
she, &lsquo;I should like for once in my life to be courtesied to
as a Christian gentlewoman.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very foolish of her, bebee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it, child?&nbsp; Where was I?&nbsp; At the
fan and sacrament; with a heavy heart I put seven score miles
between us, came back to the hairy ones, and found them
over-given to gorgious companions; said I, &lsquo;Foolish manners
is catching; all this comes of that there Gorgio.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Answers the child Leonora, &lsquo;Take comfort, bebee, I hate the
Gorgios as much as you do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say so again, bebee, as much or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time flows on, I engage in many matters, in most
miscarry.&nbsp; Am sent to prison; says I to myself, I am become
foolish.&nbsp; Am turned out of prison, and go back to the hairy
ones, who receive me not over courteously; says I, for their
unkindness, and my own foolishness, all the thanks to that
Gorgio.&nbsp; Answers to me the child, &lsquo;I wish I could set
eyes upon him, bebee.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;I did so, bebee; go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How shall I know him, bebee?&rsquo; says the
child.&nbsp; &lsquo;Young and grey, tall, and speaks
Romanly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Runs to me the child, and says,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found him, bebee.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Where,
child?&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come with me, bebee,&rsquo;
says the child.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s he,&rsquo; says I, as I
looked at my gentleman through the hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha! bebee, and here he lies, poisoned like a
hog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have taken drows, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herne;
&ldquo;do you hear, sir? drows; tip him a stave, child, of the
song of poison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon the girl clapped her hands, and sang&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Rommany churl<br />
And the Rommany girl<br />
To-morrow shall hie<br />
To poison the sty<br />
And bewitch on the mead<br />
The farmer&rsquo;s steed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, sir?&rdquo; said Mrs. Herne;
&ldquo;the child has tipped you a stave of the song of poison:
that is, she has sung it Christianly, though perhaps you would
like to hear it Romanly; you were always fond of what was
Roman.&nbsp; Tip it him Romanly, child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has heard it Romanly already, bebee; &rsquo;twas by
that I found him out, as I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo, sir, are you sleeping? you have taken drows;
the gentleman makes no answer.&nbsp; God give me
patience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what if he doesn&rsquo;t, bebee; isn&rsquo;t he
poisoned like a hog?&nbsp; Gentleman, indeed! why call him
gentleman? if he ever was one he&rsquo;s <!-- page 174--><a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>broke, and
is now a tinker, a worker of blue metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his way, child,&mdash;to-day a tinker,
to-morrow something else; and as for being drabbed, <a
name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a> I don&rsquo;t know what to say about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not drabbed! what do you mean, bebee? but look there,
bebee; ha, ha! look at the gentleman&rsquo;s motions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is sick, child, sure enough.&nbsp; Ho, ho! sir, you
have taken drows; what, another throe! writhe, sir, writhe, the
hog died by the drow of Gypsies; I saw him stretched at
evening.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s yourself, sir.&nbsp; There is no
hope, sir, no help, you have taken drow; shall I tell you your
fortune, sir, your dukkerin?&nbsp; God bless you, pretty
gentleman, much trouble will you have to suffer, and much water
to cross; but never mind, pretty gentleman, you shall be
fortunate at the end, and those who hate shall take off their
hats to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, bebee!&rdquo; cried the girl; &ldquo;what is this?
what do you mean? you have blessed the Gorgio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed him! no, sure; what did I say?&nbsp; Oh, I
remember, I&rsquo;m mad; well, I can&rsquo;t help it, I said what
the dukkerin dook <a name="citation174b"></a><a
href="#footnote174b" class="citation">[174b]</a> told me;
woe&rsquo;s me, he&rsquo;ll get up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, bebee!&nbsp; Look at his motions, he&rsquo;s
drabbed, spite of dukkerin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say so, child; he&rsquo;s sick, &rsquo;tis
true, but don&rsquo;t laugh at dukkerin, only folks do that that
know no better.&nbsp; I, for one, will never laugh at <!-- page
175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>the dukkerin dook.&nbsp; Sick again; I wish he was
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll soon be gone, bebee; let&rsquo;s leave
him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s as good as gone; look there, he&rsquo;s
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;ll get up&mdash;I feel it;
can&rsquo;t we hasten him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasten him! yes, to be sure; set the dog upon
him.&nbsp; Here, juggal, look in there, my dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog made its appearance at the door of the tent, and began
to bark and tear up the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At him, juggal, at him; he wished to poison, to drab
you.&nbsp; Halloo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog barked violently, and seemed about to spring at my
face, but retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog won&rsquo;t fly at him, child; he flashed at
the dog with his eye, and scared him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll get
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, bebee! you make me angry; how should he get
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dook tells me so, and, what&rsquo;s more, I had a
dream.&nbsp; I thought I was at York, standing amidst a crowd to
see a man hung, and the crowd shouted &lsquo;There he
comes!&rsquo; and I looked, and, lo! it was the tinker; before I
could cry with joy I was whisked away, and I found myself in
Ely&rsquo;s big church, which was chock full of people to hear
the dean preach, and all eyes were turned to the big pulpit; and
presently I heard them say, &lsquo;There he mounts!&rsquo; and I
looked up to the big pulpit, and, lo! the tinker was in the
pulpit, and he raised his arm and began to preach.&nbsp; Anon, I
found myself at York again, just as the drop fell, and I looked
up, and I saw not the tinker, but my own self hanging in the
air.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>&ldquo;You are going mad, bebee; if you want to hasten
him, take your stick and poke him in the eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be of no use, child, the dukkerin tells me
so; but I will try what I can do.&nbsp; Halloo, tinker! you must
introduce yourself into a quiet family, and raise
confusion&mdash;must you?&nbsp; You must steal its language, and,
what was never done before, write it down Christianly&mdash;must
you?&nbsp; Take that&mdash;and that;&rdquo; and she stabbed
violently with her stick towards the end of the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, bebee, you struck his face; now
once more, and let it be in the eye.&nbsp; Stay, what&rsquo;s
that? get up, bebee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one is coming; come away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me make sure of him, child; he&rsquo;ll be up
yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon Mrs. Herne, rising, leaned
forward into the tent, and, supporting herself against the pole,
took aim in the direction of the farther end.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
thrust out his eye,&rdquo; said she; and, lunging with her stick,
she would probably have accomplished her purpose had not at that
moment the pole of the tent given way, whereupon she fell to the
ground, the canvas falling upon her and her intended victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty affair, bebee,&rdquo; screamed
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get up yet,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herne, from
beneath the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&mdash;get up yourself; where are you? where is
your . . .&nbsp; Here, there, bebee, here&rsquo;s the door;
there, make haste; they are coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get up yet,&rdquo; said Mrs. Herne,
recovering her breath, &ldquo;the dook tells me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&ldquo;Never mind him or the dook; he is drabbed; come
away, or we shall be grabbed&mdash;both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more blow, I know where his head lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mad, bebee; leave the fellow&mdash;Gorgio
avella.&rdquo; <a name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a></p>
<p>And thereupon the females hurried away.</p>
<p>A vehicle of some kind was evidently drawing nigh; in a little
time it came alongside of the place where lay the fallen tent,
and stopped suddenly.&nbsp; There was a silence for a moment, and
then a parley ensued between two voices, one of which was that of
a woman.&nbsp; It was not in English, but in a deep guttural
tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peth yw hono sydd yn gorwedd yna ar y ddaear?&rdquo;
said a masculine voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yn wirionedd&mdash;I do not know what it can be,&rdquo;
said the female voice, in the same tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a cart, and there are tools; but what is that
on the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something moves beneath it; and what was that&mdash;a
groan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I get down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Peter, some one may want your
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will get down, though I do not like this place,
it is frequented by Egyptians, and I do not like their yellow
faces, nor their clibberty clabber, as Master Ellis Wyn
says.&nbsp; Now I am down.&nbsp; It is a tent, Winifred, and see,
here is a boy beneath it.&nbsp; Merciful father! what a
face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A middle-aged man, with a strongly marked and serious
countenance, dressed in sober-coloured habiliments, had lifted up
the stifling folds of the <!-- page 178--><a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>tent, and
was bending over me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you speak, my lad?&rdquo;
said he in English; &ldquo;what is the matter with you? if you
could but tell me, I could perhaps help you . . . &rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is that you say?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t hear you.&nbsp;
I will kneel down;&rdquo; and he flung himself on the ground, and
placed his ear close to my mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now speak if you
can.&nbsp; Hey! what! no, sure, God forbid!&rdquo; then starting
up, he cried to a female who sat in the cart, anxiously looking
on&mdash;&ldquo;Gwenwyn! gwenwyn! yw y gwas wedi ei
gwenwynaw.&nbsp; The oil!&nbsp; Winifred, the oil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Desired Effect&mdash;The Three
Oaks&mdash;Winifred&mdash;Things of Time&mdash;With God&rsquo;s
Will&mdash;The Preacher&mdash;Creature
Comforts&mdash;Croesaw&mdash;Welsh and English&mdash;Mayor of
Chester.</p>
<p>The oil, which the strangers compelled me to take, produced
the desired effect, though, during at least two hours, it was
very doubtful whether or not my life would be saved.&nbsp; At the
end of that period the man said, that with the blessing of God,
he would answer for my life.&nbsp; He then demanded whether I
thought I could bear to be removed from the place in which we
were, &ldquo;for I like it not,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;as
something within me tells me that it is not good for any of us to
be here.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told him, as well as I was able, that I,
too, should be glad to leave the place; whereupon, after
collecting my things, he harnessed my pony, and, with the
assistance of the woman, he contrived to place me in the cart; he
then gave me a draught out of a small phial, and we set forward
at a slow pace, the man walking by the side of the cart in which
I lay.&nbsp; It is probable that the draught consisted of a
strong opiate, for after swallowing it I fell into a deep
slumber; on my awaking, I found that the shadows of night had
enveloped the earth&mdash;we were still moving on.&nbsp; <!--
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>Shortly, however, after descending a declivity, we
turned into a lane, at the entrance of which was a gate.&nbsp;
This lane conducted to a meadow, through the middle of which ran
a small brook; it stood between two rising grounds; that on the
left, which was on the farther side of the water, was covered
with wood, whilst the one on the right, which was not so high,
was crowned with the white walls of what appeared to be a
farmhouse.</p>
<p>Advancing along the meadow, we presently came to a place where
grew three immense oaks, almost on the side of the brook, over
which they flung their arms, so as to shade it as with a canopy;
the ground beneath was bare of grass, and nearly as hard and
smooth as the floor of a barn.&nbsp; Having led his own cart on
one side of the midmost tree, and my own on the other, the
stranger said to me, &ldquo;This is the spot where my wife and
myself generally tarry in the summer season, when we come into
these parts.&nbsp; We are about to pass the night here.&nbsp; I
suppose you will have no objection to do the same?&nbsp; Indeed,
I do not see what else you could do under present
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; After receiving my answer, in which
I, of course, expressed my readiness to assent to his proposal,
he proceeded to unharness his horse, and, feeling myself much
better, I got down, and began to make the necessary preparations
for passing the night beneath the oak.</p>
<p>Whilst thus engaged, I felt myself touched on the shoulder,
and, looking round, perceived the woman, whom the stranger called
Winifred, standing close to me.&nbsp; The moon was shining
brightly upon her, and I observed that she was very good looking,
with a composed, yet cheerful <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>expression
of countenance; her dress was plain and primitive, very much
resembling that of a Quaker.&nbsp; She held a straw bonnet in her
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad to see thee moving about, young
man,&rdquo; said she, in a soft, placid tone; &ldquo;I could
scarcely have expected it.&nbsp; Thou must be wondrous strong;
many, after what thou hast suffered, would not have stood on
their feet for weeks and months.&nbsp; What do I
say?&mdash;Peter, my husband, who is skilled in medicine, just
now told me that not one in five hundred would have survived what
thou hast this day undergone; but allow me to ask thee one thing,
Hast thou returned thanks to God for thy
deliverance?&rdquo;&nbsp; I made no answer, and the woman, after
a pause, said, &ldquo;Excuse me, young man, but do you know
anything of God?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;but I should say He must be a wondrous strong
Person, if He made all those big bright things up above there, to
say nothing of the ground on which we stand, which bears beings
like these oaks, each of which is fifty times as strong as
myself, and will live twenty times as long.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
woman was silent for some moments, and then said, &ldquo;I
scarcely know in what spirit thy words are uttered.&nbsp; If thou
art serious, however, I would caution thee against supposing that
the power of God is more manifested in these trees, or even in
those bright stars above us, than in thyself&mdash;they are
things of time, but thou art a being destined to an eternity; it
depends upon thyself whether thy eternity shall be one of joy or
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she was interrupted by the man, who exclaimed from the
other side of the tree, &ldquo;Winifred, it is getting late, you
had better go <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>up to the house on the hill to
inform our friends of our arrival, or they will have retired for
the night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Winifred, and
forthwith wended her way to the house in question, returning
shortly with another woman, whom the man, speaking in the same
language which I had heard him first use, greeted by the name of
Mary; the woman replied in the same tongue, but almost
immediately said, in English, &ldquo;We hoped to have heard you
speak to-night, Peter, but we cannot expect that now, seeing that
it is so late, owing to your having been detained by the way, as
Winifred tells me; nothing remains for you to do now but to
sup&mdash;to-morrow, with God&rsquo;s will, we shall hear
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And to-night, also, with God&rsquo;s
will, provided you be so disposed.&nbsp; Let those of your family
come hither.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They will be hither
presently,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;for knowing that thou art
arrived, they will, of course, come and bid thee
welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; And scarcely had she spoke, when I beheld a
party of people descending the moonlit side of the hill.&nbsp;
They soon arrived at the place where we were; they might amount
in all to twelve individuals.&nbsp; The principal person was a
tall, athletic man, of about forty, dressed like a plain country
farmer; this was, I soon found, the husband of Mary; the rest of
the group consisted of the children of these two, and their
domestic servants.&nbsp; One after another they all shook Peter
by the hand, men and women, boys and girls, and expressed their
joy at seeing him.&nbsp; After which, he said, &ldquo;Now,
friends, if you please, I will speak a few words to
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; A stool was then brought him from the cart,
which he stepped on, and the people arranging themselves round
him, some <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>standing, some seated on the ground,
he forthwith began to address them in a clear, distinct voice;
and the subject of his discourse was the necessity, in all human
beings, of a change of heart.</p>
<p>The preacher was better than his promise, for, instead of
speaking a few words, he preached for at least three-quarters of
an hour; none of the audience, however, showed the slightest
symptom of weariness; on the contrary, the hope of each
individual appeared to hang upon the words which proceeded from
his mouth.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the sermon or discourse,
the whole assembly again shook Peter by the hand, and returned to
their house, the mistress of the family saying, as she departed,
&ldquo;I shall soon be back, Peter, I go but to make arrangements
for the supper of thyself and company;&rdquo; and, in effect, she
presently returned, attended by a young woman, who bore a tray in
her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Set it down, Jessy,&rdquo; said the
mistress to the girl, &ldquo;and then betake thyself to thy rest;
I shall remain here for a little time to talk with my
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; The girl departed, and the preacher and the
two females placed themselves on the ground about the tray.&nbsp;
The man gave thanks, and himself and his wife appeared to be
about to eat, when the latter suddenly placed her hand upon his
arm, and said something to him in a low voice, whereupon he
exclaimed, &ldquo;Ay, truly, we were both forgetful;&rdquo; and
then getting up, he came towards me, who stood a little way off,
leaning against the wheel of my cart; and, taking me by the hand,
he said, &ldquo;Pardon us, young man, we were both so engaged in
our own creature-comforts, that we forgot thee, but it is not too
late to repair our <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>fault; wilt thou not join us, and
taste our bread and milk?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot
eat,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I think I could drink a little
milk;&rdquo; whereupon he led me to the rest, and seating me by
his side, he poured some milk into a horn cup, saying,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Croesaw.&rsquo;&nbsp; That,&rdquo; added he, with a
smile, &ldquo;is Welsh for welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fare upon the tray was of the simplest description,
consisting of bread, cheese, milk, and curds.&nbsp; My two
friends partook with a good appetite.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo;
said the preacher, addressing himself to the woman of the house,
&ldquo;every time I come to visit thee, I find thee less inclined
to speak Welsh.&nbsp; I suppose, in a little time, thou wilt
entirely have forgotten it; hast thou taught it to any of thy
children?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The two eldest understand a few
words,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;but my husband does not wish
them to learn it; he says sometimes, jocularly, that though it
pleased him to marry a Welsh wife, it does not please him to have
Welsh children.&nbsp; Who, I have heard him say, would be a
Welshman, if he could be an Englishman?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I for
one,&rdquo; said the preacher, somewhat hastily; &ldquo;not to be
king of all England would I give up my birthright as a
Welshman.&nbsp; Your husband is an excellent person, Mary, but I
am afraid he is somewhat prejudiced.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do
him justice, Peter, in saying that he is an excellent
person,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;as to being prejudiced, I
scarcely know what to say, but he thinks that two languages in
the same kingdom are almost as bad as two kings.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no bad observation,&rdquo; said the preacher,
&ldquo;and it is generally the case; yet, thank God, the Welsh
and English go on very well, side by side, and I <!-- page
185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>hope will do so till the Almighty calls all men to
their long account.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They jog on very well
now,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;but I have heard my husband
say that it was not always so, and that the Welsh, in old times,
were a violent and ferocious people, for that once they hanged
the mayor of Chester.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; said the
preacher, and his eyes flashed in the moonlight; &ldquo;he told
you that, did he?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary;
&ldquo;once, when the mayor of Chester, with some of his people,
was present at one of the fairs over the border, a quarrel arose
between the Welsh and the English, and the Welsh beat the
English, and hanged the mayor.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Your husband
is a clever man,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;and knows a great
deal; did he tell you the name of the leader of the Welsh?&nbsp;
No! then I will: the leader of the Welsh on that occasion was
---.&nbsp; He was a powerful chieftain, and there was an old feud
between him and the men of Chester.&nbsp; Afterwards, when two
hundred of the men of Chester invaded his country to take revenge
for their mayor, he enticed them into a tower, set fire to it,
and burnt them all.&nbsp; That --- was a very fine,
noble&mdash;God forgive me, what was I about to say!&mdash;a very
bad, violent man; but, Mary, this is very carnal and unprofitable
conversation, and in holding it we set a very bad example to the
young man here&mdash;let us change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They then began to talk on religious matters.&nbsp; At length
Mary departed to her abode, and the preacher and his wife retired
to their tilted cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow, he seems to be almost brutally
ignorant,&rdquo; said Peter, addressing his wife in their <!--
page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>native language, after they had bidden me farewell for
the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid he is,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;yet my
heart warms to the poor lad, he seems so forlorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I slept soundly during that night, partly owing to the
influence of the opiate.&nbsp; Early in the morning I was
awakened by the voices of Peter and his wife, who were singing a
morning hymn in their own language.&nbsp; Both subsequently
prayed long and fervently.&nbsp; I lay still till their devotions
were completed, and then left my tent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good
morning,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;how dost thou
feel?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Much better,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than
I could have expected.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am glad of
it,&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art thou hungry? yonder comes
our breakfast,&rdquo; pointing to the same young woman I had seen
the preceding night, who was again descending the hill bearing
the tray upon her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou intend to do, young man, this
day?&rdquo; said Peter, when we had about half finished
breakfast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;as I do other
days, what I can.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And dost thou pass this day
as thou dost other days?&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what is there in this day different
<!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>from the rest? it seems to be of the same colour as
yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Art thou aware,&rdquo; said the
wife, interposing, &ldquo;what day it is? that it is Sabbath?
that it is Sunday?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;I did not know that it was Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
how did that happen?&rdquo; said Winifred, with a sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I live very
much alone, and pay very little heed to the passing of
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet of what infinite importance is
time,&rdquo; said Winifred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Art thou not aware that
every year brings thee nearer to thy end?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do not think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I am so near my end as I
was yesterday.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, thou art,&rdquo; said the
woman; &ldquo;thou wast not doomed to die yesterday; an invisible
hand was watching over thee yesterday; but thy day will come,
therefore improve the time; be grateful that thou wast saved
yesterday; and, oh! reflect on one thing; if thou hadst died
yesterday, where wouldst thou have been now?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cast into the earth, perhaps,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have heard Mr. Petulengro say that to be cast into the
earth is the natural end of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is Mr.
Petulengro?&rdquo; said Peter, interrupting his wife, as she was
about to speak.&nbsp; &ldquo;Master of the horse-shoe,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;and, according to his own account, king of
Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Peter,
&ldquo;head of some family of wandering Egyptians&mdash;they are
a race utterly godless.&nbsp; Art thou of them?&mdash;but no,
thou art not, thou hast not their yellow blood.&nbsp; I suppose
thou belongest to the family of wandering artisans called
---.&nbsp; I do not like you the worse for belonging to
them.&nbsp; A mighty speaker of old sprang up from amidst that
family.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;John Bunyan,&rdquo; <a name="citation188"></a><a
href="#footnote188" class="citation">[188]</a> replied Peter,
<!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>reverently, &ldquo;and the mention of his name reminds
me that I have to preach this day; wilt thou go and hear? the
distance is not great, only half a mile.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will not go and
hear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I belong to the Church,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and not to
the congregations.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! the pride of that
Church,&rdquo; said Peter, addressing his wife in their own
tongue, &ldquo;exemplified even in the lowest and most ignorant
of its members.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then thou, doubtless, meanest
to go to church,&rdquo; said Peter, again addressing me;
&ldquo;there is a church on the other side of that wooded
hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I do not mean
to go to church.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;May I ask thee
wherefore?&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;I prefer remaining beneath the shade of these trees,
listening to the sound of the leaves, and the tinkling of the
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then thou intendest to remain here?&rdquo; said Peter,
looking fixedly at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I do not intrude,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;but if I do, I will wander away; I wish to be
beholden to nobody&mdash;perhaps you wish me to go?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I wish you to
stay.&nbsp; I begin to see something in thee which has much
interest for me; but we must now bid thee farewell for the rest
of the day, the time is drawing nigh for us to repair to the
place of preaching; before we leave thee alone, however, I should
wish to ask thee a question&mdash;Didst thou seek thy own
destruction yesterday, and didst thou wilfully take that
poison?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;had I known
there had been poison in <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>the cake I
certainly should not have taken it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And who
gave it thee?&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;An enemy of
mine,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is thy
enemy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;An Egyptian sorceress and
poison-monger.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy enemy is a female.&nbsp; I
fear thou hadst given her cause to hate thee&mdash;of what did
she complain?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That I had stolen the tongue
out of her head.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not understand
thee&mdash;is she young?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;About
sixty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Winifred interposed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou didst call her
just now by hard names, young man,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I
trust thou dost bear no malice against her?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I bear no malice against
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art not wishing to deliver her into
the hand of what is called justice?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By no
means,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have lived long enough upon the
roads not to cry out for the constable when my finger is
broken.&nbsp; I consider this poisoning as an accident of the
roads; one of those to which those who travel are occasionally
subject.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In short, thou forgivest thine
adversary?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Both now and for ever,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;the spirit
which the young man displayeth pleases me much; I should be loth
that he left us yet.&nbsp; I have no doubt that, with the
blessing of God, and a little of thy exhortation, he will turn
out a true Christian before he leaveth us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My
exhortation!&rdquo; said Peter, and a dark shade passed over his
countenance; &ldquo;thou forgettest what I
am&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;but I am forgetting myself; the
Lord&rsquo;s will be done; and now put away the things, for I
perceive that our friends are coming to attend us to the place of
meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the family which I had seen the night before descended
the hill from their abode.&nbsp; They <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>were now
dressed in their Sunday&rsquo;s best.&nbsp; The master of the
house led the way.&nbsp; They presently joined us, when a quiet
sober greeting ensued on each side.&nbsp; After a little time
Peter shook me by the hand and bade me farewell till the evening;
Winifred did the same, adding, that she hoped I should be visited
by sweet and holy thoughts.&nbsp; The whole party then moved off
in the direction by which we had come the preceding night, Peter
and the master leading the way, followed by Winifred and the
mistress of the family.&nbsp; As I gazed on their departing
forms, I felt almost inclined to follow them to their place of
worship.&nbsp; I did not stir, however, but remained leaning
against my oak with my hands behind me.</p>
<p>And after a time I sat me down at the foot of the oak with my
face turned towards the water, and, folding my hands, I fell into
deep meditation.&nbsp; I thought on the early Sabbaths of my
life, and the manner in which I was wont to pass them.&nbsp; How
carefully I said my prayers when I got up on the Sabbath morn,
and how carefully I combed my hair and brushed my clothes in
order that I might do credit to the Sabbath day.&nbsp; I thought
of the old church at pretty D---, the dignified rector, and yet
more dignified clerk.&nbsp; I thought of England&rsquo;s grand
Liturgy, and Tate and Brady&rsquo;s sonorous minstrelsy.&nbsp; I
thought of the Holy Book, portions of which I was in the habit of
reading between service.&nbsp; I thought, too, of the evening
walk which I sometimes took in fine weather like the present,
with my mother and brother&mdash;a quiet sober walk, during which
I would not break into a run, even to chase a butterfly, or yet
more a honey-bee, being fully convinced of the dread importance
<!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>of the day which God had hallowed.&nbsp; And how glad I
was when I had got over the Sabbath day without having done
anything to profane it.&nbsp; And how soundly I slept on the
Sabbath night after the toil of being very good throughout the
day.</p>
<p>And when I had mused on those times a long while, I sighed and
said to myself, I am much altered since then; am I altered for
the better?&nbsp; And then I looked at my hands and my apparel,
and sighed again.&nbsp; I was not wont of yore to appear thus on
the Sabbath day.</p>
<p>For a long time I continued in a state of deep meditation,
till at last I lifted up my eyes to the sun, which, as usual
during that glorious summer, was shining in unclouded majesty;
and then I lowered them to the sparkling water, in which hundreds
of the finny brood were disporting themselves, and then I thought
what a fine thing it was to be a fish on such a fine summer day,
and I wished myself a fish, or at least amongst the fishes; and
then I looked at my hands again, and then, bending over the
water, I looked at my face in the crystal mirror, and started
when I saw it, for it looked squalid and miserable.</p>
<p>Forthwith I started up, and said to myself, I should like to
bathe and cleanse myself from the squalor produced by my late
hard life and by Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s drow.&nbsp; I wonder if there
is any harm in bathing on the Sabbath day.&nbsp; I will ask
Winifred when she comes home; in the meantime I will bathe,
provided I can find a fitting place.</p>
<p>But the brook, though a very delightful place for fish to
disport in, was shallow, and by no means adapted for the
recreation of so large a being as myself; it was, moreover,
exposed, though I saw <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>nobody at hand, nor heard a single
human voice or sound.&nbsp; Following the winding of the brook I
left the meadow, and, passing through two or three thickets, came
to a place where between lofty banks the water ran deep and dark,
and there I bathed, imbibing new tone and vigour into my languid
and exhausted frame.</p>
<p>Having put on my clothes, I returned by the way I had come to
my vehicle beneath the oak tree.&nbsp; From thence, for want of
something better to do, I strolled up the hill, on the top of
which stood the farmhouse; it was a large and commodious building
built principally of stone, and seeming of some antiquity, with a
porch, on either side of which was an oaken bench.&nbsp; On the
right was seated a young woman with a book in her hand, the same
who had brought the tray to my friends and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;pretty damsel, sitting
in the farm porch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said the girl, looking at me for a
moment, and then fixing her eyes on her book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice book you are reading,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>The girl looked at me with surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you
know what book it is?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know&mdash;never mind; but a nice book it
is&mdash;no love, no fortune-telling in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at me half offended.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fortune-telling!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I should think
not.&nbsp; But you know nothing about it;&rdquo; and she bent her
head once more over the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, young person,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I
know all about that book; what will you wager that I do
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never wager,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;Shall I tell you the name of it,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;O daughter of the dairy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl half started.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should never have
thought,&rdquo; said she, half timidly, &ldquo;that you could
have guessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not guess it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I knew it;
and meet and proper it is that you should read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can the daughter of the dairy read a more fitting book
than the &lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; said the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the water,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start, I have been bathing; are you fond of
the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the girl, heaving a sigh; &ldquo;I am
not fond of the water, that is, of the sea;&rdquo; and here she
sighed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea is a wide gulf,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
frequently separates hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you alone here?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take my turn with the rest,&rdquo; said the girl,
&ldquo;to keep at home on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are&mdash;&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The master&rsquo;s niece!&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How came you to know it?&nbsp; But why did you not go with
the rest and with your friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are those you call my friends?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter and his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are they?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know?&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;you came
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found me ill by the way,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and
they relieved me: I know nothing about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you knew everything,&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&ldquo;There are two or three things which I do not
know, and this is one of them.&nbsp; Who are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never hear of the great Welsh preacher, Peter
Williams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;this is he, and
Winifred is his wife, and a nice person she is.&nbsp; Some people
say, indeed, that she is as good a preacher as her husband,
though of that matter I can say nothing, having never heard her
preach.&nbsp; So these two wander over all Wales and the greater
part of England, comforting the hearts of the people with their
doctrine, and doing all the good they can.&nbsp; They frequently
come here, for the mistress is a Welsh woman, and an old friend
of both, and then they take up their abode in the cart beneath
the old oaks down there by the stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is their reason for doing so?&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;would it not be more comfortable to sleep beneath a
roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not their reasons,&rdquo; said the girl,
&ldquo;but so it is; they never sleep beneath a roof unless the
weather is very severe.&nbsp; I once heard the mistress say that
Peter had something heavy upon his mind; perhaps that is the
cause.&nbsp; If he is unhappy, all I can say is, that I wish him
otherwise, for he is a good man and a kind&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will now
depart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I was
wishing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? to ask me a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly; but you seem to know everything; you
mentioned, I think, fortune-telling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish me to tell your fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means; but I have a friend at a distance at sea,
and I should wish to know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;When he will come back?&nbsp; I have told you
already there are two or three things which I do not
know&mdash;this is another of them.&nbsp; However, I should not
be surprised if he were to come back some of these days; I would
if I were in his place.&nbsp; In the meantime be patient, attend
to the dairy, and read the &lsquo;Dairyman&rsquo;s
Daughter&rsquo; when you have nothing better to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was late in the evening when the party of the morning
returned.&nbsp; The farmer and his family repaired at once to
their abode, and my two friends joined me beneath the tree.&nbsp;
Peter sat down at the foot of the oak, and said nothing.&nbsp;
Supper was brought by a servant, not the damsel of the
porch.&nbsp; We sat round the tray, Peter said grace, but
scarcely anything else; he appeared sad and dejected, his wife
looked anxiously upon him.&nbsp; I was as silent as my friends;
after a little time we retired to our separate places of
rest.</p>
<p>About midnight I was awakened by a noise; I started up and
listened; it appeared to me that I heard voices and groans.&nbsp;
In a moment I had issued from my tent&mdash;all was
silent&mdash;but the next moment I again heard groans and voices;
they proceeded from the tilted cart where Peter and his wife lay;
I drew near, again there was a pause, and then I heard the voice
of Peter, in an accent of extreme anguish, exclaim, &ldquo;Pechod
Ysprydd Glan&mdash;O pechod Ysprydd Glan!&rdquo; and then he
uttered a deep groan.&nbsp; Anon, I heard the voice of Winifred,
and never shall I forget the sweetness and gentleness of the
tones of her voice in the stillness of that night.&nbsp; I did
not understand all she said&mdash;she spoke in her native
language, and I was some way apart; she appeared to endeavour to
console her <!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>husband, but he seemed to refuse all
comfort, and, with many groans, repeated&mdash;&ldquo;Pechod
Ysprydd Glan&mdash;O pechod Ysprydd Glan!&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt I
had no right to pry into their afflictions, and retired.</p>
<p>Now &ldquo;pechod Ysprydd Glan,&rdquo; interpreted, is the sin
against the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>The Following Day&mdash;Pride&mdash;Thriving
Trade&mdash;Tylwyth Teg&mdash;Ellis Wyn&mdash;Sleeping
Bard&mdash;Incalculable Good&mdash;Fearful Agony&mdash;The
Tale.</p>
<p>Peter and his wife did not proceed on any expedition during
the following day.&nbsp; The former strolled gloomily about the
fields, and the latter passed many hours in the farmhouse.&nbsp;
Towards evening, without saying a word to either, I departed with
my vehicle, and finding my way to a small town at some distance,
I laid in a store of various articles, with which I
returned.&nbsp; It was night, and my two friends were seated
beneath the oak; they had just completed their frugal
supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;We waited for thee some time,&rdquo; said
Winifred, &ldquo;but, finding that thou didst not come, we began
without thee; but sit down, I pray thee, there is still enough
for thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will sit down,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but I require no supper, for I have eaten where I have
been:&rdquo; nothing more particular occurred at the time.&nbsp;
Next morning the kind pair invited me to share their
breakfast.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will not share your breakfast,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wherefore not?&rdquo; said Winifred,
anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is not
proper that I be beholden to you for meat and drink.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But we are beholden to other people,&rdquo; said
Winifred.&nbsp; <!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but you preach to them, and give them ghostly advice,
which considerably alters the matter; not that I would receive
anything from them, if I preached to them six times a
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou art not fond of receiving favours,
then, young man?&rdquo; said Winifred.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;And of conferring
favours?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nothing affords me greater
pleasure,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than to confer
favours.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a disposition!&rdquo; said
Winifred, holding up her hands; &ldquo;and this is pride, genuine
pride&mdash;that feeling which the world agrees to call so
noble.&nbsp; Oh, how mean a thing is pride! never before did I
see all the meanness of what is called pride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how wilt thou live, friend?&rdquo; said Peter;
&ldquo;dost thou not intend to eat?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When I
went out last night,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I laid in a
provision.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast laid in a
provision!&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;pray let us see it.&nbsp;
Really, friend,&rdquo; said he, after I had produced it,
&ldquo;thou must drive a thriving trade; here are provisions
enough to last three people for several days.&nbsp; Here are
butter and eggs, here is tea, here is sugar, and there is a
flitch.&nbsp; I hope thou wilt let us partake of some of thy
fare.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I should be very happy if you
would,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubt not but we shall,&rdquo;
said Peter; &ldquo;Winifred shall have some of thy flitch cooked
for dinner.&nbsp; In the meantime, sit down, young man, and
breakfast at our expense&mdash;we will dine at thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the evening of that day, Peter and myself sat alone beneath
the oak.&nbsp; We fell into conversation; Peter was at first
melancholy, but he soon became more cheerful, fluent, and
entertaining.&nbsp; I spoke but little; but I observed that
sometimes what I said surprised the good Methodist.&nbsp; We had
been <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>silent some time.&nbsp; At length,
lifting up my eyes to the broad and leafy canopy of the trees, I
said, having nothing better to remark, &ldquo;What a noble
tree!&nbsp; I wonder if the fairies ever dance beneath
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairies!&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;fairies! how came
you, young man, to know anything about the fair
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an Englishman,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and of course
know something about fairies; England was once a famous place for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was once, I grant you,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;but is
so no longer.&nbsp; I have travelled for years about England, and
never heard them mentioned before; the belief in them has died
away, and even their name seems to be forgotten.&nbsp; If you had
said you were a Welshman, I should not have been surprised.&nbsp;
The Welsh have much to say of the Tylwyth Teg, or fair family,
and many believe in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you believe in them?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know what to say.&nbsp; Wise and good men
have been of opinion that they are nothing but devils, who, under
the form of pretty and amiable spirits, would fain allure poor
human beings; I see nothing irrational in the
supposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in devils then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I believe in devils, young man!&rdquo; said Peter,
and his frame was shaken as if by convulsions.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I
do not believe in devils, why am I here at the present
moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know best,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
believe that fairies are devils, and I don&rsquo;t wish to hear
them insulted.&nbsp; What learned men have said they are
devils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many have said it, young man, and, amongst <!-- page
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>others, Master Ellis Wyn, in that wonderful book of
his, the &lsquo;Bardd Cwsg.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Bardd Cwsg,&rsquo;&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;what kind of book is that?&nbsp; I have never heard of
that book before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard of it before!&nbsp; I suppose not; how should you
have heard of it before!&nbsp; By the bye, can you
read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very tolerably,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;so there are
fairies in this book.&nbsp; What do you call it&mdash;the
&lsquo;Bardd Cwsg&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the &lsquo;Bardd Cwsg.&rsquo;&nbsp; You pronounce
Welsh very fairly; have you ever been in Wales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not been in Wales; then, of course, you don&rsquo;t
understand Welsh; but we were talking of the &lsquo;Bardd
Cwsg,&rsquo;&mdash;yes, there are fairies in the &lsquo;Bardd
Cwsg,&rsquo;&mdash;the author of it, Master Ellis Wyn, <a
name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a> was carried away in his sleep by them
over mountains and valleys, rivers and great waters, incurring
mighty perils at their hands, till he was rescued from them by an
angel of the Most High, who subsequently showed him many
wonderful things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but what were
those wonderful things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, young man,&rdquo; said Peter, smiling,
&ldquo;that you are not without curiosity; but I can easily
pardon any one for being curious about the wonders contained in
the book of Master Ellis Wyn.&nbsp; The angel showed him the
course of this world, its pomps and vanities, its cruelty and its
pride, its crimes and deceits.&nbsp; On another occasion, the
<!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>angel showed him Death in his nether palace, surrounded
by his grisly ministers, and by those who are continually falling
victims to his power.&nbsp; And, on a third occasion, the state
of the condemned in their place of everlasting
torment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this was all in his sleep,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;was it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;in his sleep; and on
that account the book is called &lsquo;Gweledigaethau y Bardd
Cwsg,&rsquo; or, Visions of the Sleeping Bard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not care for wonders which occur in sleep,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I prefer real ones; and perhaps,
notwithstanding what he says, the man had no visions at
all&mdash;they are probably of his own invention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are substantially true, young man,&rdquo; said
Peter; &ldquo;like the dreams of Bunyan, they are founded on
three tremendous facts, Sin, Death, and Hell; and like his they
have done incalculable good, at least in my own country, in the
language of which they are written.&nbsp; Many a guilty
conscience has the &lsquo;Bardd Cwsg&rsquo; aroused with its
dreadful sights, its strong sighs, its puffs of smoke from the
pit, and its showers of sparks from the mouth of the yet lower
gulf of&mdash;Unknown&mdash;were it not for the &lsquo;Bardd
Cwsg&rsquo; perhaps I might not be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would sooner hear your own tale,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;than all the visions of the &lsquo;Bardd
Cwsg.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter shook, bent his form nearly double, and covered his face
with his hands.&nbsp; I sat still and motionless, with my eyes
fixed upon him.&nbsp; Presently Winifred descended the hill, and
joined us.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said she,
looking at her husband, who still remained in the posture I <!--
page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>have described.&nbsp; He made no answer; whereupon,
laying her hand gently on his shoulder, she said, in the peculiar
soft and tender tone which I had heard her use on a former
occasion, &ldquo;Take comfort, Peter; what has happened now to
afflict thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; Peter removed his hands from his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The old pain, the old pain,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I was talking with this young man, and he would fain know
what brought me here, he would fain hear my tale,
Winifred&mdash;my sin: O pechod Ysprydd Glan!&nbsp; O pechod
Ysprydd Glan!&rdquo; and the poor man fell into a more fearful
agony than before.&nbsp; Tears trickled down Winifred&rsquo;s
face, I saw them trickling by the moonlight, as she gazed upon
the writhing form of her afflicted husband.&nbsp; I arose from my
seat; &ldquo;I am the cause of all this,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by
my folly and imprudence, and it is thus I have returned your
kindness and hospitality; I will depart from you and wander my
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was retiring, but Peter sprang up and
detained me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you were
not in fault; if there be any fault in the case it was mine; if I
suffer, I am but paying the penalty of my own iniquity;&rdquo; he
then paused, and appeared to be considering: at length he said,
&ldquo;Many things which thou hast seen and heard connected with
me require explanation; thou wishest to know my tale, I will tell
it thee, but not now, not to-night; I am too much
shaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two evenings later, when we were again seated beneath the oak,
Peter took the hand of his wife in his own, and then, in tones
broken and almost inarticulate, commenced telling me his
tale&mdash;the tale of the Pechod Ysprydd Glan.</p>

<p>Taking a Cup&mdash;Getting to Heaven&mdash;After
Breakfast&mdash;Wooden Gallery&mdash;Mechanical
Habit&mdash;Reserved and Gloomy&mdash;Last Words&mdash;A Long
Time&mdash;From the Clouds&mdash;Ray of Hope&mdash;Momentary
Chill&mdash;Pleasing Anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born in the heart of North Wales, the son of a
respectable farmer, and am the youngest of seven brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was a member of the Church of England, and
was what is generally called a serious man.&nbsp; He went to
church regularly, and read the Bible every Sunday evening; in his
moments of leisure he was fond of holding religious discourse
both with his family and his neighbours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One autumn afternoon, on a week day, my father sat with
one of his neighbours taking a cup of ale by the oak table in our
stone kitchen.&nbsp; I sat near them, and listened to their
discourse.&nbsp; I was at that time seven years of age.&nbsp;
They were talking of religious matters.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is a hard
matter to get to heaven,&rsquo; said my father.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Exceedingly so,&rsquo; said the other.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However, I don&rsquo;t despond, none need despair of
getting to heaven, save those who have committed the sin against
the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said my father, &lsquo;thank God I
never committed that&mdash;how awful must be the state of a <!--
page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>person who has committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; I can scarcely think of it without my hair standing
on end;&rsquo; and then my father and his friend began talking of
the nature of the sin against the Holy Ghost, and I heard them
say what it was, as I sat with greedy ears listening to their
discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay awake the greater part of the night musing upon
what I had heard.&nbsp; I kept wondering to myself what must be
the state of a person who had committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost, and how he must feel.&nbsp; Once or twice I felt a strong
inclination to commit it, a strange kind of fear, however,
prevented me; at last I determined not to commit it, and, having
said my prayers, I fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I awoke in the morning the first thing I thought
of was the mysterious sin, and a voice within me seemed to say,
&lsquo;Commit it&rsquo;; and I felt a strong temptation to do so,
even stronger than in the night.&nbsp; I was just about to yield,
when the same dread, of which I have already spoken, came over
me, and, springing out of bed, I went down on my knees.&nbsp; I
slept in a small room alone, to which I ascended by a wooden
stair, open to the sky.&nbsp; I have often thought since that it
is not a good thing for children to sleep alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After breakfast I went to school, and endeavoured to
employ myself upon my tasks, but all in vain; I could think of
nothing but the sin against the Holy Ghost; my eyes, instead of
being fixed upon my book, wandered in vacancy.&nbsp; My master
observed my inattention, and chid me.&nbsp; The time came for
saying my task, and I had not acquired it.&nbsp; My master
reproached me, and, yet more, he beat <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>me; I felt
shame and anger, and I went home with a full determination to
commit the sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when I got home my father ordered me to do
something connected with the farm, so that I was compelled to
exert myself; I was occupied till night, and was so busy that I
almost forgot the sin and my late resolution.&nbsp; My work
completed, I took my supper, and went to my room; I began my
prayers, and, when they were ended, I thought of the sin, but the
temptation was slight, I felt very tired, and was presently
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus, you see, I had plenty of time allotted me by a
gracious and kind God to reflect on what I was about to do.&nbsp;
He did not permit the enemy of souls to take me by surprise, and
to hurry me at once into the commission of that which was to be
my ruin here and hereafter.&nbsp; Whatever I did was of my own
free will, after I had had time to reflect.&nbsp; Thus God is
justified; He had no hand in my destruction, but, on the
contrary, He did all that was compatible with justice to prevent
it.&nbsp; I hasten to the fatal moment.&nbsp; Awaking in the
night, I determined that nothing should prevent my committing the
sin.&nbsp; Arising from my bed, I went out upon the wooden
gallery; and having stood for a few moments looking at the stars,
with which the heavens were thickly strewn, I laid myself down,
and supporting my face with my hand, I murmured out words of
horror, words not to be repeated, and in this manner I committed
the sin against the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the words were uttered I sat up upon the topmost
step of the gallery; for some time I felt stunned in somewhat the
same manner as I once <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>subsequently felt after being stung
by an adder.&nbsp; I soon arose, however, and retired to my bed,
where, notwithstanding what I had done, I was not slow in falling
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I awoke several times during the night, each time with
the dim idea that something strange and monstrous had occurred,
but I presently fell asleep again; in the morning I awoke with
the same vague feeling, but presently recollection returned, and
I remembered that I had committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; I lay musing for some time on what I had done, and I
felt rather stunned, as before; at last I arose and got out of
bed, dressed myself, and then went down on my knees, and was
about to pray from the force of mechanical habit; before I said a
word, however, I recollected myself, and got up again.&nbsp; What
was the use of praying? I thought; I had committed the sin
against the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to school, but sat stupefied.&nbsp; I was again
chidden, again beaten by my master.&nbsp; I felt no anger this
time, and scarcely heeded the strokes.&nbsp; I looked, however,
at my master&rsquo;s face, and thought to myself, You are beating
me for being idle, as you suppose; poor man, what would you do if
you knew I had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days and weeks passed by.&nbsp; I had once been
cheerful, and fond of the society of children of my own age; but
I was now reserved and gloomy.&nbsp; It seemed to me that a gulf
separated me from all my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I used to look
at my brothers and schoolfellows, and think how different I was
from them; they had not done what I had.&nbsp; I seemed, in my
own eyes, a lone monstrous being, <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>and yet,
strange to say, I felt a kind of pride in being so.&nbsp; I was
unhappy, but I frequently thought to myself, I have done what no
one else would dare to do; there was something grand in the idea;
I had yet to learn the horror of my condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time passed on, and I began to think less of what I had
done; I began once more to take pleasure in my childish sports; I
was active, and excelled at football and the like all the lads of
my age.&nbsp; I likewise began, what I had never done before, to
take pleasure in the exercises of the school.&nbsp; I made great
progress in Welsh and English grammar, and learnt to construe
Latin.&nbsp; My master no longer chid or beat me, but one day
told my father that he had no doubt that one day I should be an
honour to Wales.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shortly after this my father fell sick; the progress of
the disorder was rapid; feeling his end approaching, he called
his children before him.&nbsp; After tenderly embracing us, he
said, &lsquo;God bless you, my children; I am going from you, but
take comfort, I trust that we shall all meet again in
heaven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As he uttered these last words, horror took entire
possession of me.&nbsp; Meet my father in heaven,&mdash;how could
I ever hope to meet him there?&nbsp; I looked wildly at my
brethren and at my mother; they were all bathed in tears, but how
I envied them.&nbsp; They might hope to meet my father in heaven,
but how different were they from me, they had never committed the
unpardonable sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few days my father died; he left his family in
comfortable circumstances, at least such as would be considered
so in Wales, where the wants of the people are few.&nbsp; My
elder brother <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>carried on the farm for the benefit
of my mother and us all.&nbsp; In course of time my brothers were
put out to various trades.&nbsp; I still remained at school, but
without being a source of expense to my relations, as I was by
this time able to assist my master in the business of the
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was diligent both in self-improvement and in the
instruction of others; nevertheless, a horrible weight pressed
upon my breast; I knew I was a lost being; that for me there was
no hope; that, though all others might be saved, I must of
necessity be lost: I had committed the unpardonable sin, for
which I was doomed to eternal punishment, in the flaming gulf, as
soon as life was over!&mdash;and how long could I hope to live?
perhaps fifty years; at the end of which I must go to my place;
and then I would count the months and the days, nay, even the
hours which yet intervened between me and my doom.&nbsp;
Sometimes I would comfort myself with the idea that a long time
would elapse before my time would be out; but then again I
thought that, however long the term might be, it must be out at
last; and then I would fall into an agony, during which I would
almost wish that the term were out, and that I were in my place;
the horrors of which I thought could scarcely be worse than what
I then endured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one thought about this time which caused me
unutterable grief and shame, perhaps more shame than grief.&nbsp;
It was that my father, who was gone to heaven, and was there
daily holding communion with his God, was by this time aware of
my crime.&nbsp; I imagined him looking down from the clouds upon
his wretched son, with a countenance <!-- page 210--><a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>of
inexpressible horror.&nbsp; When this idea was upon me, I would
often rush to some secret place to hide myself; to some thicket,
where I would cast myself on the ground, and thrust my head into
a thick bush, in order to escape from the horror-struck glance of
my father above in the clouds; and there I would continue
groaning till the agony had, in some degree, passed away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wretchedness of my state increasing daily, it at
last became apparent to the master of the school, who questioned
me earnestly and affectionately.&nbsp; I, however, gave him no
satisfactory answer, being apprehensive that, if I unbosomed
myself, I should become as much an object of horror to him as I
had long been to myself.&nbsp; At length he suspected that I was
unsettled in my intellects; and, fearing probably the ill effect
of my presence upon his scholars, he advised me to go home; which
I was glad to do, as I felt myself every day becoming less
qualified for the duties of the office which I had
undertaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I returned home to my mother and my brother, who
received me with the greatest kindness and affection.&nbsp; I now
determined to devote myself to husbandry, and assist my brother
in the business of the farm.&nbsp; I was still, however, very
much distressed.&nbsp; One fine morning, however, as I was at
work in the field, and the birds were carolling around me, a ray
of hope began to break upon my poor dark soul.&nbsp; I looked at
the earth and looked at the sky, and felt as I had not done for
many a year; presently a delicious feeling stole over me.&nbsp; I
was beginning to enjoy existence.&nbsp; I shall never forget that
hour.&nbsp; I flung myself on the <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>soil, and
kissed it; then, springing up with a sudden impulse, I rushed
into the depths of a neighbouring wood, and, falling upon my
knees, did what I had not done for a long, long time&mdash;prayed
to God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A change, an entire change, seemed to have come over
me.&nbsp; I was no longer gloomy and despairing, but gay and
happy.&nbsp; My slumbers were light and easy; not disturbed, as
before, by frightful dreams.&nbsp; I arose with the lark, and
like him uttered a cheerful song of praise to God, frequently and
earnestly, and was particularly cautious not to do anything which
I considered might cause His displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At church I was constant, and when there listened with
deepest attention to every word which proceeded from the mouth of
the minister.&nbsp; In a little time it appeared to me that I had
become a good, very good young man.&nbsp; At times the
recollection of the sin would return, and I would feel a
momentary chill; but the thought quickly vanished, and I again
felt happy and secure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Sunday morning, after I had said my prayers, I felt
particularly joyous.&nbsp; I thought of the innocent and virtuous
life I was leading; and when the recollection of the sin intruded
for a moment, I said, &lsquo;I am sure God will never utterly
cast away so good a creature as myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; I went to
church, and was as usual attentive.&nbsp; The subject of the
sermon was on the duty of searching the Scriptures: all I knew of
them was from the Liturgy.&nbsp; I now, however, determined to
read them, and perfect the good work which I had begun.&nbsp; My
father&rsquo;s Bible was upon the shelf, and <!-- page 212--><a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>on that
evening I took it with me to my chamber.&nbsp; I placed it on the
table, and sat down.&nbsp; My heart was filled with pleasing
anticipation.&nbsp; I opened the book at random, and began to
read; the first passage on which my eyes lighted was the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He who committeth the sin against the Holy Ghost
shall not be forgiven, either in this world or the
next.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Peter was seized with convulsive tremors.&nbsp; Winifred
sobbed violently.&nbsp; I got up, and went away.&nbsp; Returning
in about a quarter of an hour, I found him more calm; he motioned
me to sit down; and, after a short pause, continued his
narration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was I, young man?&nbsp; Oh, I remember, at the
fatal passage which removed all hope.&nbsp; I will not dwell on
what I felt.&nbsp; I closed my eyes, and wished that I might be
dreaming; but it was no dream, but a terrific reality: I will not
dwell on that period, I should only shock you.&nbsp; I could not
bear my feelings; so, bidding my friends a hasty farewell, I
abandoned myself to horror and despair, and ran wild through
Wales, climbing mountains and wading streams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climbing mountains and wading streams, I ran wild
about, I was burnt by the sun, drenched by the rain, and had
frequently at night no other covering than the sky, or the humid
roof of some cave; but nothing seemed to affect my constitution;
probably the fire which burned within me counteracted what I
suffered from without.&nbsp; During the space of three years I
scarcely knew what befell <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>me; my life
was a dream&mdash;a wild, horrible dream; more than once I
believe I was in the hands of robbers, and once in the hands of
Gypsies.&nbsp; I liked the last description of people least of
all; I could not abide their yellow faces, or their ceaseless
clabber.&nbsp; Escaping from these beings, whose countenances and
godless discourse brought to my mind the demons of the deep
Unknown, I still ran wild through Wales, I know not how
long.&nbsp; On one occasion, coming in some degree to my
recollection, I felt myself quite unable to bear the horrors of
my situation; looking round, I found myself near the sea;
instantly the idea came into my head that I would cast myself
into it, and thus anticipate my final doom.&nbsp; I hesitated a
moment, but a voice within me seemed to tell me that I could do
no better; the sea was near, and I could not swim, so I
determined to fling myself into the sea.&nbsp; As I was running
along at great speed, in the direction of a lofty rock, which
beetled over the waters, I suddenly felt myself seized by the
coat.&nbsp; I strove to tear myself away, but in vain; looking
round, I perceived a venerable hale old man, who had hold of
me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me go!&rsquo; said I, fiercely.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will not let thee go,&rsquo; said the old man, and now
instead of with one, he grappled me with both hands.&nbsp;
&lsquo;In whose name dost thou detain me?&rsquo; said I, scarcely
knowing what I said.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the name of my Master, who
made thee and yonder sea; and has said to the sea, so far shalt
thou come, and no farther, and to thee, thou shalt do no
murder.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Has not a man a right to do what he
pleases with his own?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has,&rsquo;
said the old man, &lsquo;but thy life is not thy own; thou art
accountable for it to thy God.&nbsp; Nay, I <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>will not
let thee go,&rsquo; he continued, as I again struggled; &lsquo;if
thou struggle with me the whole day I will not let thee go, as
Charles Wesley says, in his &ldquo;Wrestlings of Jacob&rdquo;;
and see, it is of no use struggling, for I am, in the strength of
my Master, stronger than thou;&rsquo; and, indeed, all of a
sudden I had become very weak and exhausted; whereupon the old
man, beholding my situation, took me by the arm and led me gently
to a neighbouring town, which stood behind a hill, and which I
had not before observed; presently he opened the door of a
respectable-looking house, which stood beside a large building
having the appearance of a chapel, and conducted me into a small
room, with a great many books in it.&nbsp; Having caused me to
sit down, he stood looking at me for some time, occasionally
heaving a sigh.&nbsp; I was, indeed, haggard and forlorn.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who art thou?&rsquo; he said at last.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
miserable man,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;What makes thee
miserable?&rsquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &lsquo;A hideous
crime,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can find no rest; like
Cain I wander here and there.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man turned
pale.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hast thou taken another&rsquo;s life?&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;if so, I advise thee to surrender thyself to the
magistrate; thou canst do no better; thy doing so will be the
best proof of thy repentance; and though there be no hope for
thee in this world there may be much in the next.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I have never taken
another&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What then,
another&rsquo;s goods?&nbsp; If so, restore them seven-fold, if
possible: or, if it be not in thy power, and thy conscience
accuse thee, surrender thyself to the magistrate, and make the
only satisfaction thou art able.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have taken
no one&rsquo;s goods,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Of what art
thou guilty, then?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Art thou a
drunkard? a <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>profligate?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Alas, no,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;I am neither of these;
would that I were no worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereupon the old man looked steadfastly at me for some
time; then, after appearing to reflect, he said, &lsquo;Young
man, I have a great desire to know your name.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;What matters it to you what is my name?&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;you know nothing of me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps you
are mistaken,&rsquo; said the old man, looking kindly at me;
&lsquo;but at all events tell me your name.&rsquo;&nbsp; I
hesitated a moment, and then told him who I was, whereupon he
exclaimed with much emotion, &lsquo;I thought so; how wonderful
are the ways of Providence.&nbsp; I have heard of thee, young
man, and know thy mother well.&nbsp; Only a month ago, when upon
a journey, I experienced much kindness from her.&nbsp; She was
speaking to me of her lost child, with tears; she told me that
you were one of the best of sons, but that some strange idea
appeared to have occupied your mind.&nbsp; Despair not, my
son.&nbsp; If thou hast been afflicted, I doubt not but that thy
affliction will eventually turn out to thy benefit; I doubt not
but that thou wilt be preserved, as an example of the great mercy
of God.&nbsp; I will now kneel down and pray for thee, my
son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knelt down, and prayed long and fervently.&nbsp; I
remained standing for some time; at length I knelt down
likewise.&nbsp; I scarcely knew what he was saying, but when he
concluded I said &lsquo;Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we had risen from our knees, the old man left
me for a short time, and on his return led me into another room,
where were two females; one was an elderly person, the wife of
the old man,&mdash;the other was a young woman of very
prepossessing appearance (hang not down thy head, Winifred), who
I soon found was a distant relation <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>of the old
man,&mdash;both received me with great kindness, the old man
having doubtless previously told them who I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I staid several days in the good man&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; I had still the greater portion of a small sum which
I happened to have about me when I departed on my dolorous
wandering, and with this I purchased clothes, and altered my
appearance considerably.&nbsp; On the evening of the second day,
my friend said, &lsquo;I am going to preach, perhaps you will
come and hear me.&rsquo;&nbsp; I consented, and we all went, not
to a church, but to the large building next the house,&mdash;for
the old man, though a clergyman, was not of the established
persuasion,&mdash;and there the old man mounted a pulpit, and
began to preach.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come unto Me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden,&rsquo; etc. etc., was his text.&nbsp; His
sermon was long, but I still bear the greater portion of it in my
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The substance of it was that Jesus was at all times
ready to take upon Himself the burden of our sins, provided we
came to Him with a humble and contrite spirit, and begged His
help.&nbsp; This doctrine was new to me; I had often been at
church, but had never heard it preached before, at least so
distinctly.&nbsp; When he said that all men might be saved, I
shook, for I expected he would add, all except those who had
committed the mysterious sin; but no, all men were to be saved
who with a humble and contrite spirit would come to Jesus, cast
themselves at the foot of His cross, and accept pardon through
the merits of His blood-shedding alone.&nbsp; &lsquo;Therefore,
my friends,&rsquo; said he, in conclusion, &lsquo;despair
not&mdash;however guilty you may be, despair not&mdash;however
desperate <!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>your condition may seem,&rsquo; said
he, fixing his eyes upon me, &lsquo;despair not.&nbsp; There is
nothing more foolish and more wicked than despair; overweening
confidence is not more foolish than despair; both are the
favourite weapons of the enemy of souls.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This discourse gave rise in my mind to no slight
perplexity.&nbsp; I had read in the Scriptures that he who
committeth a certain sin shall never be forgiven, and that there
is no hope for him either in this world or the next.&nbsp; And
here was a man, a good man certainly, and one who, of necessity,
was thoroughly acquainted with the Scriptures, who told me that
any one might be forgiven, however wicked, who would only trust
in Christ and in the merits of His blood-shedding.&nbsp; Did I
believe in Christ?&nbsp; Ay, truly.&nbsp; Was I willing to be
saved by Christ?&nbsp; Ay, truly.&nbsp; Did I trust in
Christ?&nbsp; I trusted that Christ would save every one but
myself.&nbsp; And why not myself? simply because the Scriptures
had told me that he who has committed the sin against the Holy
Ghost can never be saved, and I had committed the sin against the
Holy Ghost,&mdash;perhaps the only one who ever had committed
it.&nbsp; How could I hope?&nbsp; The Scriptures could not lie,
and yet here was this good old man, profoundly versed in the
Scriptures, who bade me hope; would he lie?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But
did the old man know my case?&nbsp; Ah, no, he did not know my
case! but yet he had bid me hope, whatever I had done, provided I
would go to Jesus.&nbsp; But how could I think of going to Jesus,
when the Scriptures told me plainly that all would be
useless?&nbsp; I was perplexed, and yet a ray of hope <!-- page
219--><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>began to dawn in my soul.&nbsp; I thought of consulting
the good man, but I was afraid he would drive away the small
glimmer.&nbsp; I was afraid he would say, &lsquo;Oh yes, every
one is to be saved, except a wretch like you; I was not aware
before that there was anything so
horrible,&mdash;begone!&rsquo;&nbsp; Once or twice the old man
questioned me on the subject of my misery, but I evaded him;
once, indeed, when he looked particularly benevolent, I think I
should have unbosomed myself to him, but we were
interrupted.&nbsp; He never pressed me much; perhaps he was
delicate in probing my mind, as we were then of different
persuasions.&nbsp; Hence he advised me to seek the advice of some
powerful minister in my own Church; there were many such in it,
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I staid several days in the family, during which time I
more than once heard my venerable friend preach; each time he
preached, he exhorted his hearers not to despair.&nbsp; The whole
family were kind to me; his wife frequently discoursed with me,
and also the young person to whom I have already alluded.&nbsp;
It appeared to me that the latter took a peculiar interest in my
fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last my friend said to me, &lsquo;It is now time
thou shouldest return to thy mother and thy brother.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So I arose, and departed to my mother and my brother; and at my
departure my old friend gave me his blessing, and his wife and
the young person shed tears, the last especially.&nbsp; And when
my mother saw me, she shed tears, and fell on my neck and kissed
me, and my brother took me by the hand and bade me welcome; and
when our first emotions were subsided, my mother <!-- page
220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>said, &lsquo;I trust thou art come in a lucky
hour.&nbsp; A few weeks ago my cousin (whose favourite thou
always wast) died and left thee his heir&mdash;left thee the
goodly farm in which he lived.&nbsp; I trust, my son, that thou
wilt now settle, and be a comfort to me in my old
days.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I answered, &lsquo;I will, if so please
the Lord;&rsquo; and I said to myself, &lsquo;God grant that this
bequest be a token of the Lord&rsquo;s favour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in a few days I departed to take possession of my
farm; it was about twenty miles from my mother&rsquo;s house, in
a beautiful but rather wild district; I arrived at the fall of
the leaf.&nbsp; All day long I busied myself with my farm, and
thus kept my mind employed.&nbsp; At night, however, I felt
rather solitary, and I frequently wished for a companion.&nbsp;
Each night and morning I prayed fervently unto the Lord; for His
hand had been very heavy upon me, and I feared Him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one thing connected with my new abode, which
gave me considerable uneasiness&mdash;the want of spiritual
instruction.&nbsp; There was a church, indeed, close at hand, in
which service was occasionally performed, but in so hurried and
heartless a manner that I derived little benefit from it.&nbsp;
The clergyman to whom the benefice belonged was a valetudinarian,
who passed his time in London, or at some watering-place,
entrusting the care of his flock to the curate of a distant
parish, who gave himself very little trouble about the
matter.&nbsp; Now I wanted every Sunday to hear from the pulpit
words of consolation and encouragement, similar to those which I
had heard uttered from the pulpit by my good and venerable
friend, but I was debarred from this privilege.&nbsp; At length,
<!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>one day being in conversation with one of my labourers,
a staid and serious man, I spoke to him of the matter which lay
heavy upon my mind; whereupon, looking me wistfully in the face,
he said, &lsquo;Master, the want of religious instruction in my
church was what drove me to the Methodists.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Methodists,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;are there any in
these parts?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;There is a chapel,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;only half a mile distant, at which there are two
services every Sunday, and other two during the
week.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now it happened that my venerable friend was
of the Methodist persuasion, and when I heard the poor man talk
in this manner, I said to him, &lsquo;May I go with you next
Sunday?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said he; so I went
with the labourer on the ensuing Sabbath to the meeting of the
Methodists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked the preaching which I heard at the chapel very
well, though it was not quite so comfortable as that of my old
friend, the preacher being in some respects a different kind of
man.&nbsp; It, however, did me good, and I went again, and
continued to do so, though I did not become a regular member of
the body at that time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had now the benefit of religious instruction, and
also to a certain extent of religious fellowship, for the
preacher and various members of his flock frequently came to see
me.&nbsp; They were honest plain men, not exactly of the
description which I wished for, but still good sort of people,
and I was glad to see them.&nbsp; Once on a time, when some of
them were with me, one of them inquired whether I was fervent in
prayer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very fervent,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And do you read the Scriptures often?&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because I am afraid to see there my own
condemnation.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>They looked
at each other, and said nothing at the time.&nbsp; On leaving me,
however, they all advised me to read the Scriptures with fervency
and prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I had told these honest people, I shrank from
searching the Scriptures; the remembrance of the fatal passage
was still too vivid in my mind to permit me.&nbsp; I did not wish
to see my condemnation repeated, but I was very fervent in
prayer, and almost hoped that God would yet forgive me by virtue
of the blood-shedding of the Lamb.&nbsp; Time passed on, my
affairs prospered, and I enjoyed a certain portion of
tranquillity.&nbsp; Occasionally, when I had nothing else to do,
I renewed my studies.&nbsp; Many is the book I read, especially
in my native language, for I was always fond of my native
language, and proud of being a Welshman.&nbsp; Amongst the books
I read were the odes of the great Ab Gwilym, whom thou, friend,
hast never heard of; no, nor any of thy countrymen, for you are
an ignorant race, you Saxons, at least with respect to all that
relates to Wales and Welshmen.&nbsp; I likewise read the book of
Master Ellis Wyn.&nbsp; The latter work possessed a singular
fascination for me, on account of its wonderful delineations of
the torments of the nether world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But man does not love to be alone; indeed, the
Scripture says that it is not good for man to be alone.&nbsp; I
occupied my body with the pursuits of husbandry, and I improved
my mind with the perusal of good and wise books; but, as I have
already said, I frequently sighed for a companion with whom I
could exchange ideas, and who could take an interest in my
pursuits; the want of such <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>a one I
more particularly felt in the long winter evenings.&nbsp; It was
then that the image of the young person whom I had seen in the
house of the preacher frequently rose up distinctly before my
mind&rsquo;s eye, decked with quiet graces&mdash;hang not down
your head, Winifred&mdash;and I thought that of all the women in
the world I should wish her to be my partner, and then I
considered whether it would be possible to obtain her.&nbsp; I am
ready to acknowledge, friend, that it was both selfish and wicked
in me to wish to fetter any human being to a lost creature like
myself, conscious of having committed a crime for which the
Scriptures told me there is no pardon.&nbsp; I had, indeed, a
long struggle as to whether I should make the attempt or
not&mdash;selfishness, however, prevailed.&nbsp; I will not
detain your attention with relating all that occurred at this
period&mdash;suffice it to say that I made my suit and was
successful; it is true that the old man, who was her guardian,
hesitated, and asked several questions respecting my state of
mind.&nbsp; I am afraid that I partly deceived him, perhaps he
partly deceived himself; he was pleased that I had adopted his
profession&mdash;we are all weak creatures.&nbsp; With respect to
the young person, she did not ask many questions; and I soon
found that I had won her heart.&nbsp; To be brief, I married her;
and here she is, the truest wife that ever man had, and the
kindest.&nbsp; Kind I may well call her, seeing that she shrinks
not from me, who so cruelly deceived her, in not telling her at
first what I was.&nbsp; I married her, friend; and brought her
home to my little possession, where we passed our time very
agreeably.&nbsp; Our affairs prospered, our garners were full,
and there was <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>coin in our purse.&nbsp; I worked in
the field; Winifred busied herself with the dairy.&nbsp; At night
I frequently read books to her, books of my own country, friend;
I likewise read to her songs of my own, holy songs and carols
which she admired, and which yourself would perhaps admire, could
you understand them; but I repeat, you Saxons are an ignorant
people with respect to us, and a perverse, inasmuch as you
despise Welsh without understanding it.&nbsp; Every night I
prayed fervently, and my wife admired my gift of prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night, after I had been reading to my wife a
portion of Ellis Wyn, my wife said, &lsquo;This is a wonderful
book, and containing much true and pleasant doctrine; but how is
it that you, who are so fond of good books, and good things in
general, never read the Bible?&nbsp; You read me the book of
Master Ellis Wyn, you read me sweet songs of your own
composition, you edify me with your gift of prayer, but yet you
never read the Bible.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when I heard her mention
the Bible I shook, for I thought of my own condemnation.&nbsp;
However, I dearly loved my wife, and as she pressed me, I
commenced on that very night reading the Bible.&nbsp; All went on
smoothly for a long time; for months and months I did not find
the fatal passage, so that I almost thought that I had imagined
it.&nbsp; My affairs prospered much the while, so that I was
almost happy,&mdash;taking pleasure in everything around
me,&mdash;in my wife, in my farm, my books and compositions, and
the Welsh language; till one night, as I was reading the Bible,
feeling particularly comfortable, a thought having just come into
my head that I would print some of my compositions, and purchase
a particular <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>field of a neighbour&mdash;O
God&mdash;God!&nbsp; I came to the fatal passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend, friend, what shall I say?&nbsp; I rushed
out.&nbsp; My wife followed me, asking me what was the
matter.&nbsp; I could only answer with groans&mdash;for three
days and three nights I did little else than groan.&nbsp; Oh, the
kindness and solicitude of my wife!&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the
matter, husband, dear husband?&rsquo; she was continually
saying.&nbsp; I became at last more calm.&nbsp; My wife still
persisted in asking me the cause of my late paroxysm.&nbsp; It is
hard to keep a secret from a wife, especially such a wife as
mine, so I told my wife the tale, as we sat one night&mdash;it
was a mid-winter night&mdash;over the dying brands of our hearth,
after the family had retired to rest, her hand locked in mine,
even as it is now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she would have shrunk from me with horror;
but she did not; her hand, it is true, trembled once or twice;
but that was all.&nbsp; At last she gave mine a gentle pressure;
and, looking up in my face, she said&mdash;what do you think my
wife said, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to guess,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let us go to rest, my love; your fears are all
groundless.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so I still say,&rdquo; said Winifred,
sobbing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us retire to rest, dear husband; your
fears are groundless.&nbsp; I had hoped long since that your
affliction would have passed away, and I still hope that it
eventually will; so take heart, Peter, and let us retire to rest,

<p>&ldquo;Rest!&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;there is no rest for

<p>&ldquo;We are all wicked,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;but you
are afraid of a shadow.&nbsp; How often have I told you that the
sin of your heart is not the sin against the Holy Ghost: the sin
of your heart is its natural pride, of which you are scarcely
aware, to keep down which God in His mercy permitted you to be
terrified with the idea of having committed a sin which you never
committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will still maintain,&rdquo; said Peter,
&ldquo;that I never committed the sin against the Holy
Spirit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;you never
committed it.&nbsp; How should a child seven years old commit a
sin like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did not the first words which I read in the
Holy Scripture condemn me?&nbsp; &lsquo;He who committeth the sin
against the Holy Ghost shall never enter into the kingdom of
God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never committed it,&rdquo; said Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the words! the words! the words!&rdquo; said
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The words are true words,&rdquo; said Winifred,
sobbing; &ldquo;but they were not meant for you, but for those
who have broken their profession, who, having embraced the cross,
have receded from their Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what sayst thou to the effect which the words
produced upon me?&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did they not
cause me to run wild through Wales for years, like Merddin Wyllt
of yore; thinkest thou that I opened the book at that particular
passage by chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;not by chance; it was
the hand of God directed you, doubtless for some wise
purpose.&nbsp; You had become satisfied with yourself.&nbsp; The
Lord wished to rouse thee from thy state of carnal security, and
therefore directed your eyes to that fearful passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the Lord then carry out His designs by means of
guile?&rdquo; said Peter, with a groan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is not the
Lord true?&nbsp; Would the Lord impress upon me that I had
committed a sin of which I am guiltless?&nbsp; Hush, Winifred!
hush! thou knowest that I have committed the sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast not committed it,&rdquo; said Winifred,
sobbing yet more violently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were they my last words,
I would persist that thou hast not committed <!-- page 228--><a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>it, though,
perhaps, thou wouldst, but for this chastening; it was not to
convince thee that thou hast committed the sin, but rather to
prevent thee from committing it, that the Lord brought that
passage before thy eyes.&nbsp; He is not to blame, if thou art
wilfully blind to the truth and wisdom of His ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see thou wouldst comfort me,&rdquo; said Peter,
&ldquo;as thou hast often before attempted to do.&nbsp; I would
fain ask the young man his opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not yet heard the whole of your history,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My story is nearly told,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;a
few words will complete it.&nbsp; My wife endeavoured to console
and reassure me, using the arguments which you have just heard
her use, and many others, but in vain.&nbsp; Peace nor comfort
came to my breast.&nbsp; I was rapidly falling into the depths of
despair; when one day Winifred said to me, &lsquo;I see thou wilt
be lost, if we remain here.&nbsp; One resource only
remains.&nbsp; Thou must go forth, my husband, into the wide
world, and to comfort thee I will go with thee.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And what can I do in the wide world?&rsquo; said I,
despondingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much,&rsquo; replied Winifred,
&lsquo;if you will but exert yourself; much good canst thou do
with the blessing of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many things of the same
kind she said to me; and at last I arose from the earth to which
God had smitten me, and disposed of my property in the best way I
could, and went into the world.&nbsp; We did all the good we were
able, visiting the sick, ministering to the sick, and praying
with the sick.&nbsp; At last I became celebrated as the possessor
of a great gift of prayer.&nbsp; And people urged me to preach,
and Winifred urged me too, and at last I <!-- page 229--><a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>consented,
and I preached.&nbsp; I&mdash;I&mdash;outcast Peter, became the
preacher Peter Williams.&nbsp; I, the lost one, attempted to show
others the right road.&nbsp; And in this way I have gone on for
thirteen years, preaching and teaching, visiting the sick, and
ministering to them, with Winifred by my side heartening me
on.&nbsp; Occasionally I am visited with fits of indescribable
agony, generally on the night before the Sabbath; for I then ask
myself, how dare I, the outcast, attempt to preach the word of
God?&nbsp; Young man, my tale is told; you seem in
thought!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking of London Bridge,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of London Bridge!&rdquo; said Peter and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of London Bridge.&nbsp; I am
indebted for much wisdom to London Bridge; it was there that I
completed my studies.&nbsp; But to the point.&nbsp; I was once
reading on London Bridge a book which an ancient gentlewoman, who
kept the bridge, was in the habit of lending me; and there I
found written, &lsquo;Each one carries in his breast the
recollection of some sin which presses heavy upon him.&nbsp; O!
if men could but look into each other&rsquo;s hearts, what
blackness would they find there!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is the name of the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Life of Blessed Mary
Flanders.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some popish saint, I suppose,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much of a saint, I dare say,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;as most popish ones; but you interrupted me.&nbsp; One
part of your narrative brought the passage which I have quoted
into my mind.&nbsp; You said that after you had committed this
same sin of yours you <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>were in the habit, at school, of
looking upon your schoolfellows with a kind of gloomy
superiority, considering yourself a lone monstrous being who had
committed a sin far above the daring of any of them.&nbsp; Are
you sure that many others of your schoolfellows were not looking
upon you and the others with much the same eyes with which you
were looking upon them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;dost thou think that
they had divined my secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not they,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they were, I dare say,
thinking too much of themselves and of their own concerns to have
divined any secrets of yours.&nbsp; All I mean to say is, they
had probably secrets of their own, and who knows that the secret
sin of more than one of them was not the very sin which caused
you so much misery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dost thou then imagine,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;the
sin against the Holy Ghost to be so common an
occurrence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you have described it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of very
common occurrence, especially amongst children, who are, indeed,
the only beings likely to commit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;the young man talks
wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter was silent for some moments, and appeared to be
reflecting; at last, suddenly raising his head, he looked me full
in the face, and, grasping my hand with vehemence, he said,
&ldquo;Tell me, young man, only one thing, hast thou, too,
committed the sin against the Holy Ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am neither Papist, nor Methodist,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but of the Church, and, being so, confess myself to no
one, but keep my own counsel; I will tell <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>thee,
however, had I committed, at the same age, twenty such sins as
that which you committed, I should feel no uneasiness at these
years&mdash;but I am sleepy, and must go to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless thee, young man,&rdquo; said Winifred.</p>

<p>Low and Calm&mdash;Much Better&mdash;Blessed Effect&mdash;No
Answer&mdash;Such a Sermon.</p>
<p>Before I sank to rest I heard Winifred and her husband
conversing in the place where I had left them; both their voices
were low and calm.&nbsp; I soon fell asleep, and slumbered for
some time.&nbsp; On my awakening I again heard them conversing,
but they were now in their cart; still the voices of both were
calm.&nbsp; I heard no passionate bursts of wild despair on the
part of the man.&nbsp; Methought I occasionally heard the word
Pechod proceeding from the lips of each, but with no particular
emphasis.&nbsp; I supposed they were talking of the innate sin of
both their hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that man were happy,&rdquo; said I to myself,
&ldquo;were it only for his wife&rsquo;s sake, and yet he
deserves to be happy for his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Peter was very cheerful, more cheerful than I had
ever seen him.&nbsp; At breakfast his conversation was animated,
and he smiled repeatedly.&nbsp; I looked at him with the greatest
interest, and the eyes of his wife were almost constantly fixed
upon him.&nbsp; A shade of gloom would occasionally come over his
countenance, but it almost instantly disappeared; perhaps it
proceeded <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>more from habit than anything
else.&nbsp; After breakfast he took his Welsh Bible and sat down
beneath a tree.&nbsp; His eyes were soon fixed intently on the
volume; now and then he would call his wife, show her some
passage, and appeared to consult with her.&nbsp; The day passed
quickly and comfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband seems much better,&rdquo; said I, at
evening-fall, to Winifred, as we chanced to be alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;and that on the
day of the week when he was wont to appear most melancholy, for
to-morrow is the Sabbath.&nbsp; He now no longer looks forward to
the Sabbath with dread, but appears to reckon on it.&nbsp; What a
happy change! and to think that this change should have been
produced by a few words, seemingly careless ones, proceeding from
the mouth of one who is almost a stranger to him.&nbsp; Truly, it
is wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom do you allude,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and to
what words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To yourself, and to the words which came from your lips
last night, after you had heard my poor husband&rsquo;s
history.&nbsp; Those strange words, drawn out with so much
seeming indifference, have produced in my husband the blessed
effect which you have observed.&nbsp; They have altered the
current of his ideas.&nbsp; He no longer thinks himself the only
being in the world doomed to destruction,&mdash;the only being
capable of committing the never-to-be-forgiven sin.&nbsp; Your
supposition that that which harrowed his soul is of frequent
occurrence amongst children, has tranquillised him; the mist
which hung over his mind has cleared away, and he begins to see
the groundlessness of his <!-- page 234--><a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>apprehensions.&nbsp; The Lord has permitted him to be
chastened for a season, but his lamp will only burn the brighter
for what he has undergone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sunday came, fine and glorious as the last.&nbsp; Again my
friends and myself breakfasted together&mdash;again the good
family of the house on the hill above, headed by the respectable
master, descended to the meadow.&nbsp; Peter and his wife were
ready to receive them.&nbsp; Again Peter placed himself at the
side of the honest farmer, and Winifred by the side of her
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou not come?&rdquo; said Peter,
looking towards me with a face in which there was much
emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilt thou not come?&rdquo; said Winifred,
with a face beaming with kindness.&nbsp; But I made no answer,
and presently the party moved away, in the same manner in which
it had moved on the preceding Sabbath, and I was again left
alone.</p>
<p>The hours of the Sabbath passed slowly away.&nbsp; I sat
gazing at the sky, the trees, and the water.&nbsp; At last I
strolled up to the house and sat down in the porch.&nbsp; It was
empty; there was no modest maiden there, as on the preceding
Sabbath.&nbsp; The damsel of the book had accompanied the
rest.&nbsp; I had seen her in the procession, and the house
appeared quite deserted.&nbsp; The owners had probably left it to
my custody, so I sat down in the porch, quite alone.&nbsp; The
hours of the Sabbath passed heavily away.</p>
<p>At last evening came, and with it the party of the
morning.&nbsp; I was now at my place beneath the oak.&nbsp; I
went forward to meet them.&nbsp; Peter and his wife received me
with a calm and quiet greeting, and passed forward.&nbsp; The
rest of the party had broke into groups.&nbsp; There was a kind
of excitement <!-- page 235--><a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>amongst them, and much eager
whispering.&nbsp; I went to one of the groups; the young girl of
whom I have spoken more than once, was speaking: &ldquo;Such a
sermon,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it has never been our lot to
hear; Peter never before spoke as he has done this day&mdash;he
was always a powerful preacher, but oh, the unction of the
discourse of this morning, and yet more of that of the afternoon,
which was the continuation of it!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What was
the subject?&rdquo; said I, interrupting her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!
you should have been there, young man, to have heard it; it would
have made a lasting impression upon you.&nbsp; I was bathed in
tears all the time; those who heard it will never forget the
preaching of the good Peter Williams on the Power, Providence,
and Goodness of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morrow I said to my friends, &ldquo;I am about to
depart; farewell!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Depart!&rdquo; said Peter
and his wife, simultaneously; &ldquo;whither wouldst thou
go?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here all my
days,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said
Peter; &ldquo;but we had no idea of losing thee so soon: we had
almost hoped that thou wouldst join us, become one of us.&nbsp;
We are under infinite obligations to thee.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mean I am under infinite obligations to you,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you not save my life?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps so, under God,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;and what
hast thou not done for me?&nbsp; Art thou aware that, under God,
thou hast preserved my soul from despair?&nbsp; But, independent
of that, we like thy company, and feel a deep interest in thee,
and would fain teach thee the way that is right.&nbsp; Hearken,
to-morrow we go into Wales; go with us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have no wish to go into Wales,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo; said Peter, with animation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wales is a
goodly country; as the Scripture says&mdash;a land of brooks of
water, of fountains and depths, that <!-- page 237--><a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>spring out
of valleys and hills, a land whose stones are iron, and out of
whose hills thou mayest dig <i>lead</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is a very fine country,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but I have no wish to go there just now; my destiny seems
to point in another direction, to say nothing of my
trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou dost right to say nothing of thy
trade,&rdquo; said Peter, smiling, &ldquo;for thou seemest to
care nothing about it; which has led Winifred and myself to
suspect that thou art not altogether what thou seemest; but,
setting that aside, we should be most happy if thou wouldst go
with us into Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot promise to go
with you into Wales,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but, as you depart
to-morrow, I will stay with you through the day, and on the
morrow accompany you part of the way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Peter: &ldquo;I have many people to see
to-day, and so has Winifred; but we will both endeavour to have
some serious discourse with thee, which, perhaps, will turn to
thy profit in the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of the day the good Peter came to me, as I was
seated beneath the oak, and, placing himself by me, commenced
addressing me in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt, my young friend, that you are willing
to admit, that the most important thing which a human being
possesses is his soul; it is of infinitely more importance than
the body, which is a frail substance, and cannot last for many
years; but not so the soul, which, by its nature, is
imperishable.&nbsp; To one of two mansions the soul is destined
to depart, after its separation from the body, to heaven or hell;
to the halls of eternal bliss, where God and His holy angels
dwell, or to the place of endless <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>misery,
inhabited by Satan and his grisly companions.&nbsp; My friend, if
the joys of heaven are great, unutterably great, so are the
torments of hell unutterably so.&nbsp; I wish not to speak of
them, I wish not to terrify your imagination with the torments of
hell: indeed, I like not to think of them; but it is necessary to
speak of them sometimes, and to think of them sometimes, lest you
should sink into a state of carnal security.&nbsp; Authors,
friend, and learned men, are not altogether agreed as to the
particulars of hell.&nbsp; They all agree, however, in
considering it a place of exceeding horror.&nbsp; Master Ellis
Wyn, who by the bye was a churchman, calls it, amongst other
things, a place of strong sighs, and of flaming sparks.&nbsp;
Master Rees Pritchard, <a name="citation238"></a><a
href="#footnote238" class="citation">[238]</a> who was not only a
churchman, but Vicar of Llandovery, and flourished about two
hundred years ago&mdash;I wish many like him flourished
now&mdash;speaking of hell, in his collection of sweet hymns,
called the &lsquo;Welshman&rsquo;s Candle,&rsquo; observes,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The pool is continually blazing; it is very
deep, without any known bottom, and the walls are so high, that
there is neither hope nor possibility of escaping over
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as I told you just now, I have no great pleasure
in talking of hell.&nbsp; No, friend, no; I would sooner talk of
the other place, and of the goodness and hospitality of God
amongst His saints above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the excellent man began to dilate upon the joys of
heaven, and the goodness and hospitality of God in the mansions
above; explaining to me, in the clearest way, how I might get
there.</p>
<p>And when he had finished what he had to say, <!-- page
239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>he
left me, whereupon Winifred drew nigh, and sitting down by me,
began to address me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not think,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;from what I have observed of thee, that thou wouldst
wish to be ungrateful, and yet, is not thy whole life a series of
ingratitude, and to whom?&mdash;to thy Maker.&nbsp; Has He not
endowed thee with a goodly and healthy form; and senses which
enable thee to enjoy the delights of His beautiful
universe&mdash;the work of His hands?&nbsp; Canst thou not enjoy,
even to rapture, the brightness of the sun, the perfume of the
meads, and the song of the dear birds, which inhabit among the
trees?&nbsp; Yes, thou canst; for I have seen thee, and observed
thee doing so.&nbsp; Yet, during the whole time that I have known
thee, I have not heard proceed from thy lips one single word of
praise or thanksgiving to . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in this manner the admirable woman proceeded for a
considerable time, and to all her discourse I listened with
attention; and when she had concluded, I took her hand and said,
&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; and that was all.</p>
<p>On the next day everything was ready for our departure.&nbsp;
The good family of the house came to bid us farewell.&nbsp; There
were shaking of hands, and kisses, as on the night of our
arrival.</p>
<p>And as I stood somewhat apart, the young girl of whom I have
spoken so often, came up to me, and holding out her hand, said,
&ldquo;Farewell, young man, wherever thou goest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, after looking around her, she said, &ldquo;It was all true
you told me.&nbsp; Yesterday I received a letter from him thou
wottest of, he is coming soon.&nbsp; God bless you, young man;
who would have thought thou knewest so much!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>So, after we had taken our farewell of the good family,
we departed, proceeding in the direction of Wales.&nbsp; Peter
was very cheerful, and enlivened the way with godly discourse and
spiritual hymns, some of which were in the Welsh language.&nbsp;
At length I said, &ldquo;It is a pity that you did not continue
in the Church; you have a turn for psalmody, and I have heard of
a man becoming a bishop by means of a less
qualification.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very probably,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;more the
pity.&nbsp; But I have told you the reason of my forsaking
it.&nbsp; Frequently, when I went to the church door, I found it
barred, and the priest absent; what was I to do?&nbsp; My heart
was bursting for want of some religious help and comfort; what
could I do? as good Master Rees Pritchard observes in his
&lsquo;Candle for Welshmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is a doleful thing to see little children
burning on the hot coals for want of help; but yet more doleful
to see a flock of souls falling into the burning lake for want of
a priest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church of England is a fine church,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I would not advise any one to speak ill of the Church of
England before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say against the Church,&rdquo; said
Peter; &ldquo;all I wish is that it would fling itself a little
more open, and that its priests would a little more bestir
themselves; in a word, that it would shoulder the cross and
become a missionary church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too proud for that,&rdquo; said Winifred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are much more of a Methodist,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;than your husband.&nbsp; But tell me,&rdquo; said I,
addressing myself to Peter, &ldquo;do you not differ from the
Church in some points of doctrine?&nbsp; I, of course, as a true
<!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>member of the Church, am quite ignorant of the peculiar
opinions of wandering sectaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the pride of that Church!&rdquo; said Winifred,
half to herself; &ldquo;wandering sectaries!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We differ in no points of doctrine,&rdquo; said Peter;
&ldquo;we believe all the Church believes, though we are not so
fond of vain and superfluous ceremonies, snow-white neckcloths
and surplices, as the Church is.&nbsp; We likewise think that
there is no harm in a sermon by the road-side, or in holding free
discourse with a beggar beneath a hedge, or a tinker,&rdquo; he
added, smiling; &ldquo;it was those superfluous ceremonies, those
surplices and white neckcloths, and, above all, the necessity of
strictly regulating his words and conversation, which drove John
Wesley out of the Church, and sent him wandering up and down as
you see me, poor Welsh Peter, do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing farther passed for some time; we were now drawing near
the hills: at last I said, &ldquo;You must have met with a great
many strange adventures since you took up this course of
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;it has been my lot to
meet with; but none more strange than one which occurred to me
only a few weeks ago.&nbsp; You were asking me, not long since,
whether I believed in devils?&nbsp; Ay, truly, young man; and I
believe that the abyss and the yet deeper Unknown do not contain
them all; some walk about upon the green earth.&nbsp; So it
happened, some weeks ago, that I was exercising my ministry about
forty miles from here.&nbsp; I was alone, Winifred being slightly
indisposed, staying for a few days at the house of an
acquaintance; I had finished afternoon&rsquo;s worship&mdash;the
people had dispersed, and I was sitting solitary <!-- page
242--><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>by
my cart under some green trees in a quiet retired place; suddenly
a voice said to me, &lsquo;Good evening, Pastor&rsquo;; I looked
up, and before me stood a man, at least the appearance of a man,
dressed in a black suit of rather a singular fashion.&nbsp; He
was about my own age, or somewhat older.&nbsp; As I looked upon
him, it appeared to me that I had seen him twice before whilst
preaching.&nbsp; I replied to his salutation, and perceiving that
he looked somewhat fatigued, I took out a stool from the cart,
and asked him to sit down.&nbsp; We began to discourse; I at
first supposed that he might be one of ourselves, some wandering
minister; but I was soon undeceived.&nbsp; Neither his language
nor his ideas were those of any one of our body.&nbsp; He spoke
on all kinds of matters with much fluency; till at last he
mentioned my preaching, complimenting me on my powers.&nbsp; I
replied, as well I might, that I could claim no merit of my own,
and that if I spoke with any effect, it was only by the grace of
God.&nbsp; As I uttered these last words, a horrible kind of
sneer came over his countenance, which made me shudder, for there
was something diabolical in it.&nbsp; I said little more, but
listened attentively to his discourse.&nbsp; At last he said that
I was engaged in a paltry cause, quite unworthy of one of my
powers.&nbsp; &lsquo;How can that be,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;even
if I possessed all the powers in the world, seeing that I am
engaged in the cause of our Lord Jesus?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same kind of sneer again came on his countenance,
but he almost instantly observed, that if I chose to forsake this
same miserable cause, from which nothing but contempt and
privation were to be expected, he would enlist me into another,
from which I might expect both profit and renown.&nbsp; An <!--
page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>idea now came into my head, and I told him firmly, that
if he wished me to forsake my present profession and become a
member of the Church of England, I must absolutely decline; that
I had no ill-will against that Church, but I thought I could do
most good in my present position, which I would not forsake to be
Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; Thereupon he burst into a strange
laughter, and went away, repeating to himself, &lsquo;Church of
England!&nbsp; Archbishop of Canterbury!&rsquo;&nbsp; A few days
after, when I was once more in a solitary place, he again
appeared before me, and asked me whether I had thought over his
words, and whether I was willing to enlist under the banners of
his master, adding, that he was eager to secure me, as he
conceived that I might be highly useful to the cause.&nbsp; I
then asked him who his master was; he hesitated for a moment, and
then answered, &lsquo;The Roman Pontiff.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;If
it be he,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I can have nothing to do with
him, I will serve no one who is an enemy of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon he drew near to me, and told me not to talk so much
like a simpleton; that as for Christ, it was probable that no
such person ever existed, but that if he ever did, he was the
greatest impostor the world ever saw.&nbsp; How long he continued
in this way I know not, for I now considered that an evil spirit
was before me, and shrank within myself, shivering in every limb;
when I recovered myself and looked about me, he was gone.&nbsp;
Two days after, he again stood before me, in the same place, and
about the same hour, renewing his propositions, and speaking more
horribly than before.&nbsp; I made him no answer; whereupon he
continued; but suddenly hearing a noise behind him, he looked
round and beheld <!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Winifred, who had returned to me on
the morning of that day.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; said
he, fiercely.&nbsp; &lsquo;This man&rsquo;s wife,&rsquo; said
she, calmly fixing her eyes upon him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Begone from
him, unhappy one, thou temptest him in vain.&rsquo;&nbsp; He made
no answer, but stood as if transfixed: at length recovering
himself, he departed, muttering &lsquo;Wife! wife!&nbsp; If the
fool has a wife, he will never do for us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were now drawing very near the hills, and Peter said,
&ldquo;If you are to go into Wales, you must presently decide,
for we are close upon the border.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is the border?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon small brook,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;into which
the man on horseback who is coming towards us is now
entering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the man; he stops
in the middle of it, as if to water his steed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We proceeded till we had nearly reached the brook.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;will you go into
Wales?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I do in Wales?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do!&rdquo; said Peter, smiling; &ldquo;learn
Welsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped my little pony.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I need not go into
Wales; I already know Welsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know Welsh!&rdquo; said Peter, staring at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know Welsh!&rdquo; said Winifred, stopping her
cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How and when did you learn it?&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From books, in my boyhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>&ldquo;Read Welsh!&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;is it
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read Welsh!&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;is it
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope you will come with us,&rdquo; said
Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us, young man,&rdquo; said Winifred;
&ldquo;let me, on the other side of the brook, welcome you into
Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you both,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I will not
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; exclaimed both, simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is neither fit nor proper that I cross into
Wales at this time, and in this manner.&nbsp; When I go into
Wales, I should wish to go in a new suit of superfine black, with
hat and beaver, <a name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a> mounted on a powerful steed, black and
glossy, like that which bore Greduv to the fight of
Catraeth.&nbsp; I should wish, moreover, to see the Welshmen
assembled on the border ready to welcome me with pipe and fiddle,
and much whooping and shouting, and to attend me to Wrexham, or
even as far as Machynllaith, where I should wish to be invited to
a dinner at which all the bards should be present, and to be
seated at the right hand of the president, who, when the cloth
was removed, should arise, and, amidst cries of silence,
exclaim&mdash;&lsquo;Brethren and Welshmen, allow me to propose
the health of my most respectable friend the translator of the
odes of the great Ab Gwilym, the pride and glory of
Wales.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;hast thou translated the
works of the mighty Dafydd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With notes critical, historical, and
explanatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>&ldquo;Come with us, friend,&rdquo; said Peter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot promise such a dinner as thou wishest, but
neither pipe nor fiddle shall be wanting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us, young man,&rdquo; said Winifred,
&ldquo;even as thou art, and the daughters of Wales shall bid
thee welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not go with you,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dost thou see that man in the ford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is staring at us so, and whose horse has not yet
done drinking?&nbsp; Of course I see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall turn back with him.&nbsp; God bless
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back with him not,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;he is
one of those whom I like not, one of the clibberty clabber, as
Master Ellis Wyn observes&mdash;turn not with that
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go not back with him,&rdquo; said Winifred.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If thou goest with that man, thou wilt soon forget all our
profitable counsels; come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot; I have much to say to him.&nbsp; Kosko
Divvus, Mr. Petulengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kosko Divvus, Pal,&rdquo; <a name="citation247"></a><a
href="#footnote247" class="citation">[247]</a> said Mr.
Petulengro, riding through the water; &ldquo;are you turning
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned back with Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; Peter came running
after me: &ldquo;One moment, young man,&mdash;who and what are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must answer in the words of Taliesin,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;none can say with positiveness whether I be fish or flesh,
least of all myself.&nbsp; God bless you both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; said Peter, and he thrust his Welsh
Bible into my hand.</p>

<p>At a Funeral&mdash;Two Days Ago&mdash;Very Coolly&mdash;Roman

Lane&mdash;Beyond the Time&mdash;Fine Fellow&mdash;Such a
Struggle&mdash;Like a Wild Cat&mdash;Fair Play&mdash;Pleasant
Enough Spot&mdash;No Gloves.</p>
<p>So I turned back with Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; We travelled for
some time in silence; at last we fell into discourse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have been in Wales, Mr. Petulengro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, truly, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assisting at a funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At whose funeral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she dead, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a nail, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By hanging, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am lost in astonishment,&rdquo; said I; whereupon Mr.
Petulengro, lifting his sinister leg over the neck of his steed,
and adjusting himself sideways in the saddle, replied, with great
deliberation, &ldquo;Two days ago, I happened to be at a fair not
very far from here; I was all alone by myself, for our party were
upwards of forty miles off, when who should <!-- page 249--><a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>come up but
a chap that I knew, a relation, or rather, a connection of
mine&mdash;one of those Hernes.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
you going to the funeral?&rsquo; said he; and then, brother,
there passed between him and me, in the way of questioning and
answering, much the same as has just now passed between I and
you; but when he mentioned hanging, I thought I could do no less
than ask who hanged her, which you forgot to do.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who
hanged her?&rsquo; said I; and then the man told me that she had
done it herself,&mdash;been her own hinjiri; <a
name="citation249a"></a><a href="#footnote249a"
class="citation">[249a]</a> and then I thought to myself what a
sin and shame it would be if I did not go to the funeral, seeing
that she was my own mother-in-law.&nbsp; I would have brought my
wife, and, indeed, the whole of our party, but there was no time
for that; they were too far off, and the dead was to be buried
early the next morning; so I went with the man, and he led me
into Wales, where his party had lately retired, and when there,
through many wild and desolate places to their encampment, and
there I found the Hernes, and the dead body&mdash;the last laid
out on a mattress, in a tent, dressed Romaneskoen&aelig;s <a
name="citation249b"></a><a href="#footnote249b"
class="citation">[249b]</a> in a red cloak, and big bonnet of
black beaver.&nbsp; I must say for the Hernes that they took the
matter very coolly; some were eating, others drinking, and some
were talking about their small affairs; there was one, however,
who did not take the matter so coolly, but took on enough for the
whole family, sitting beside the dead woman, tearing her hair,
and refusing to take either meat or drink; it was the child
Leonora.&nbsp; I arrived at night-fall, and the <!-- page
250--><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>burying was not to take place till the morning, which I
was rather sorry for, as I am not very fond of them Hernes, who
are not very fond of anybody.&nbsp; They never asked me to eat or
drink, notwithstanding I had married into the family; one of
them, however, came up and offered to fight me for five
shillings; had it not been for them I should have come back as
empty as I went&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t stand up five
minutes.&nbsp; Brother, I passed the night as well as I could,
beneath a tree, for the tents were full, and not over clean; I
slept little, and had my eyes about me, for I knew the kind of
people I was among.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early in the morning the funeral took place.&nbsp; The
body was placed not in a coffin but on a bier, and carried not to
a churchyard but to a deep dell close by; and there it was buried
beneath a rock, dressed just as I have told you; and this was
done by the bidding of Leonora, who had heard her bebee say that
she wished to be buried, not in gorgious fashion, but like a
Roman woman of the old blood, the kosko puro rati, <a
name="citation250a"></a><a href="#footnote250a"
class="citation">[250a]</a> brother.&nbsp; When it was over, and
we had got back to the encampment, I prepared to be going.&nbsp;
Before mounting my gry, <a name="citation250b"></a><a
href="#footnote250b" class="citation">[250b]</a> however, I
bethought me to ask what could have induced the dead woman to
make away with herself&mdash;a thing so uncommon amongst
Rommanies; whereupon one squinted with his eyes, a second spirted
saliver into the air, and a third said that he neither knew nor
cared; she was a good riddance, having more than once been nearly
the ruin of them all, from the quantity of brimstone she carried
about her.&nbsp; One, however, I suppose <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>rather
ashamed of the way in which they had treated me, said at last,
that if I wanted to know all about the matter, none could tell me
better than the child, who was in all her secrets, and was not a
little like her; so I looked about for the child, but could find
her nowhere.&nbsp; At last the same man told me that he
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I found her at the grave; so I went
back to the grave, and sure enough there I found the child
Leonora, seated on the ground above the body, crying and taking
on; so I spoke kindly to her, and said, &lsquo;How came all this,
Leonora? tell me all about it.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a long time
before I could get any answer; at last she opened her mouth and
spoke, and these were the words she said, &lsquo;It was all along
of your Pal;&rsquo; <a name="citation251"></a><a
href="#footnote251" class="citation">[251]</a> and then she told
me all about the matter&mdash;how Mrs. Herne could not abide you,
which I knew before; and that she had sworn your destruction,
which I did not know before.&nbsp; And then she told me how she
found you living in the wood by yourself, and how you were
enticed to eat a poisoned cake; and she told me many other things
that you wot of, and she told me what perhaps you don&rsquo;t
wot, namely, that finding you had been removed, she, the child,
had tracked you a long way, and found you at last well and
hearty, and no ways affected by the poison, and heard you, as she
stood concealed, disputing about religion with a Welsh
Methody.&nbsp; Well, brother, she told me all this; and,
moreover, that when Mrs. Herne heard of it, she said that a dream
of hers had come to pass.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what it was,
but something about herself, a tinker, and a dean; and then she
added, that it was all up with her, and that she must take a long
journey.&nbsp; Well, <!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>brother, that same night Leonora,
waking from her sleep in the tent where Mrs. Herne and she were
wont to sleep, missed her bebee, <a name="citation252a"></a><a
href="#footnote252a" class="citation">[252a]</a> and, becoming
alarmed, went in search of her, and at last found her hanging
from a branch; and when the child had got so far, she took on
violently, and I could not get another word from her; so I left
her, and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am glad to see you, Mr. Petulengro; but this is
sad news which you tell me about Mrs. Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhat dreary, brother; yet, perhaps, after all, it
is a good thing that she is removed; she carried so much
Devil&rsquo;s tinder about with her, as the man said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for her,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;more
especially as I am the cause of her death&mdash;though the
innocent one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could not bide you, brother, that&rsquo;s certain;
but that is no reason&rdquo;&mdash;said Mr. Petulengro, balancing
himself upon the saddle&mdash;&ldquo;that is no reason why she
should prepare drow to take away your essence of life; and, when
disappointed, to hang herself upon a tree: if she was
dissatisfied with you, she might have flown at you, and scratched
your face; or, if she did not judge herself your match, she might
have put down five shillings for a turn up between you and some
one she thought could beat you&mdash;myself, for example, and so
the matter might have ended comfortably; but she was always too
fond of covert ways, drows, and brimstones.&nbsp; This is not the
first poisoning affair she has been engaged in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You allude to drabbing bawlor.&rdquo; <a
name="citation252b"></a><a href="#footnote252b"
class="citation">[252b]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 253--><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s no harm in that.&nbsp; No, no! she has cast
drows <a name="citation253a"></a><a href="#footnote253a"
class="citation">[253a]</a> in her time for other guess things
than bawlor; both Gorgios and Romans have tasted of them, and
died.&nbsp; Did you never hear of the poisoned plum
pudding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will tell you about it.&nbsp; It happened about
six years ago, a few months after she had quitted us&mdash;she
had gone first amongst her own people, as she called them; but
there was another small party of Romans, with whom she soon
became very intimate.&nbsp; It so happened that this small party
got into trouble; whether it was about a horse or an ass, or
passing bad money, no matter to you and me, who had no hand in
the business; three or four of them were taken and lodged in ---
Castle, and amongst them was a woman; but the sherengro, or
principal man of the party, and who it seems had most hand in the
affair, was still at large.&nbsp; All of a sudden a rumour was
spread abroad that the woman was about to play false, and to
&rsquo;peach the rest.&nbsp; Said the principal man, when he
heard it, &lsquo;If she does, I am nashkado.&rsquo; <a
name="citation253b"></a><a href="#footnote253b"
class="citation">[253b]</a>&nbsp; Mrs. Herne was then on a visit
to the party, and when she heard the principal man take on so,
she said, &lsquo;But I suppose you know what to do?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then hir mi
devlis,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you are a fool.&nbsp; But leave
the matter to me, I know how to dispose of her in Roman
fashion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why she wanted to interfere in the matter,
brother, I don&rsquo;t know, unless it was from pure
brimstoneness of disposition&mdash;she had no hand in the matter
which <!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>had brought the party into
trouble&mdash;she was only on a visit, and it had happened before
she came; but she was always ready to give dangerous
advice.&nbsp; Well, brother, the principal man listened to what
she had to say, and let her do what she would; and she made a
pudding, a very nice one, no doubt&mdash;for, besides plums, she
put in drows and all the Roman condiments that she knew of; and
she gave it to the principal man, and the principal man put it
into a basket and directed it to the woman in --- Castle, and the
woman in the castle took it and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ate of it,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;just like my
case!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite different, brother; she took it, it is true, but
instead of giving way to her appetite, as you might have done,
she put it before the rest whom she was going to impeach; perhaps
she wished to see how they liked it before she tasted it herself;
and all the rest were poisoned, and one died, and there was a
precious outcry, and the woman cried loudest of all; and she
said, &lsquo;It was my death was sought for; I know the man, and
I&rsquo;ll be revenged.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then the Poknees <a
name="citation254a"></a><a href="#footnote254a"
class="citation">[254a]</a> spoke to her and said, &lsquo;Where
can we find him?&rsquo; and she said, &lsquo;I am awake to his
motions; three weeks from hence, the night before the full moon,
at such and such an hour, he will pass down such a lane with such
a man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and what did the Poknees
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, brother! sent for a plastramengro <a
name="citation254b"></a><a href="#footnote254b"
class="citation">[254b]</a> from Bow Street, quite secretly, and
told him what the woman had said; and the night before the full
moon, the plastramengro went to the place which <!-- page
255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>the juwa <a name="citation255a"></a><a
href="#footnote255a" class="citation">[255a]</a>had pointed out,
all alone, brother; and in order that he might not be too late,
he went two hours before his time.&nbsp; I know the place well,
brother, where the plastramengro placed himself behind a thick
holly tree, at the end of a lane, where a gate leads into various
fields, through which there is a path for carts and horses.&nbsp;
The lane is called the dark lane by the Gorgios, being much
shaded by trees.&nbsp; So the plastramengro placed himself in the
dark lane behind the holly tree; it was a cold February night,
dreary though; the wind blew in gusts, and the moon had not yet
risen, and the plastramengro waited behind the tree till he was
tired, and thought he might as well sit down; so he sat down, and
was not long in falling to sleep, and there he slept for some
hours; and when he awoke the moon had risen, and was shining
bright, so that there was a kind of moonlight even in the dark
lane; and the plastramengro pulled out his watch, and contrived
to make out that it was just two hours beyond the time when the
men should have passed by.&nbsp; Brother, I do not know what the
plastramengro thought of himself, but I know, brother, what I
should have thought of myself in his situation.&nbsp; I should
have thought, brother, that I was a drowsy scoppelo, <a
name="citation255b"></a><a href="#footnote255b"
class="citation">[255b]</a> and that I had let the fellow pass by
whilst I was sleeping behind a bush.&nbsp; As it turned out,
however, his going to sleep did no harm, but quite the contrary:
just as he was going away, he heard a gate slam in the direction
of the fields, and then he heard the low stumping of horses, as
if on soft ground, for the path in those fields is generally
soft, and at that time it had been lately ploughed <!-- page
256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>up.&nbsp; Well, brother, presently he saw two men on
horseback coming towards the lane through the field behind the
gate; the man who rode foremost was a tall big fellow, the very
man he was in quest of; the other was a smaller chap, not so
small either, but a light, wiry fellow, and a proper master of
his hands when he sees occasion for using them.&nbsp; Well,
brother, the foremost man came to the gate, reached at the hank,
undid it, and rode through, holding it open for the other.&nbsp;
Before, however, the other could follow into the lane, out bolted
the plastramengro from behind the tree, kicked the gate to with
his foot, and, seizing the big man on horseback, &lsquo;You are
my prisoner,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; I am of opinion, brother, that
the plastramengro, notwithstanding he went to sleep, must have
been a regular fine fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am entirely of your opinion,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but what happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, brother, the Rommany chal, after he had somewhat
recovered from his surprise, for it is rather uncomfortable to be
laid hold of at night-time, and told you are a prisoner; more
especially when you happen to have two or three things on your
mind which, if proved against you, would carry you to the nashky.
<a name="citation256"></a><a href="#footnote256"
class="citation">[256]</a>&nbsp; The Rommany chal, I say, clubbed
his whip, and aimed a blow at the plastramengro, which, if it had
hit him on the skull, as was intended, would very likely have
cracked it.&nbsp; The plastramengro, however, received it partly
on his staff, so that it did him no particular damage.&nbsp;
Whereupon, seeing what kind of customer he had to deal with, he
dropped his staff and seized the chal with both his hands, who
forthwith spurred his <!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>horse, hoping, by doing so, either
to break away from him, or fling him down; but it would not
do&mdash;the plastramengro held on like a bulldog, so that the
Rommany chal, <a name="citation257a"></a><a href="#footnote257a"
class="citation">[257a]</a> to escape being hauled to the ground,
suddenly flung himself off the saddle, and then happened in that
lane, close by the gate, such a struggle between those
two&mdash;the chal and the runner&mdash;as I suppose will never
happen again.&nbsp; But you must have heard of it; every one has
heard of it; every one has heard of the fight between the Bow
Street engro <a name="citation257b"></a><a href="#footnote257b"
class="citation">[257b]</a> and the Rommany chal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of it till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All England rung of it, brother.&nbsp; There never was
a better match than between those two.&nbsp; The runner was
somewhat the stronger of the two&mdash;all these engroes are
strong fellows&mdash;and a great deal cooler, for all of that
sort are wondrous cool people&mdash;he had, however, to do with
one who knew full well how to take his own part.&nbsp; The chal
fought the engro, brother, in the old Roman fashion.&nbsp; He
bit, he kicked, and screamed like a wild cat of Benygant; casting
foam from his mouth, and fire from his eyes.&nbsp; Sometimes he
was beneath the engro&rsquo;s legs, and sometimes he was upon his
shoulders.&nbsp; What the engro found the most difficult, was to
get a firm hold of the chal, for no sooner did he seize the chal
by any part of his wearing apparel, than the chal either tore
himself away, or contrived to slip out of it; so that in a little
time the chal was three parts naked; and as for holding him by
the body, it was out of the question, for he was as slippery as
an eel.&nbsp; At last the engro seized the chal by the
Belcher&rsquo;s handkerchief, <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>which he
wore in a knot round his neck, and do whatever the chal could, he
could not free himself; and when the engro saw that, it gave him
fresh heart, no doubt: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of no use,&rsquo; said
he; &lsquo;you had better give in; hold out your hands for the
darbies, or I will throttle you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did the other fellow do, who came with the
chal?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat still on my horse, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you the
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was he, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you not help your comrade?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have fought in the ring, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what had fighting in the ring to do with fighting
in the lane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean not fighting.&nbsp; A great deal, brother; it
taught me to prize fair play.&nbsp; When I fought Staffordshire
Dick, t&rsquo;other side of London, I was alone, brother.&nbsp;
Not a Rommany chal to back me, and he had all his brother pals
about him; but they gave me fair play, brother; and I beat
Staffordshire Dick, which I couldn&rsquo;t have done had they put
one finger on his side the scale; for he was as good a man as
myself, or nearly so.&nbsp; Now, brother, had I but bent a finger
in favour of the Rommany chal, the plastramengro would never have
come alive out of the lane; but I did not, for I thought to
myself fair play is a precious stone; so you see,
brother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you are quite right, Mr. Petulengro, I see that
clearly; and now, pray proceed with your narration; it is both
moral and entertaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mr. Petulengro did not proceed with his narration, neither
did he proceed upon his way; he had stopped his horse, and his
eyes were <!-- page 259--><a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>intently fixed on a broad strip of
grass beneath some lofty trees, on the left side of the
road.&nbsp; It was a pleasant enough spot, and seemed to invite
wayfaring people, such as we were, to rest from the fatigues of
the road, and the heat and vehemence of the sun.&nbsp; After
examining it for a considerable time, Mr. Petulengro said,
&ldquo;I say, brother, that would be a nice place for a
tussle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it would,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if two
people were inclined to fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground is smooth,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&ldquo;without holes or ruts, and the trees cast much
shade.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think, brother, that we could find a
better place,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, springing from his
horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and I don&rsquo;t want to fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself, brother,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, I will tell you how the matter
stands.&nbsp; There is a point at present between us.&nbsp; There
can be no doubt that you are the cause of Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s
death, innocently, you will say, but still the cause.&nbsp; Now,
I shouldn&rsquo;t like it to be known that I went up and down the
country with a pal who was the cause of my mother-in-law&rsquo;s
death, that&rsquo;s to say, unless he gave me satisfaction.&nbsp;
Now, if I and my pal have a tussle, he gives me satisfaction;
and, if he knocks my eyes out, which I know you can&rsquo;t do,
it makes no difference at all, he gives me satisfaction; and he
who says to the contrary, knows nothing of Gypsy law, and is a
dinelo <a name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259"
class="citation">[259]</a> into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we have no gloves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gloves!&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, contemptuously,
&ldquo;gloves!&nbsp; I tell you what, brother, <!-- page 260--><a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>I always
thought you were a better hand at the gloves than the naked fist;
and, to tell you the truth, besides taking satisfaction for Mrs.
Herne&rsquo;s death, I wish to see what you can do with your
mawleys; <a name="citation260"></a><a href="#footnote260"
class="citation">[260]</a> so now is your time, brother, and this
is your place, grass and shade, no ruts or holes; come on,
brother, or I shall think you what I should not like to call
you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span

<p>Offence and Defence&mdash;I&rsquo;m Satisfied&mdash;Fond of
Solitude&mdash;Possession of Property&mdash;Chal
Devlehi&mdash;Winding Path.</p>
<p>And when I heard Mr. Petulengro talk in this manner, which I
had never heard him do before, and which I can only account for
by his being fasting and ill-tempered, I had of course no other
alternative than to accept his challenge; so I put myself into a
posture which I deemed the best both for offence and defence, and
the tussle commenced; and when it had endured for about half an
hour, Mr. Petulengro said, &ldquo;Brother, there is much blood on
your face; you had better wipe it off;&rdquo; and when I had
wiped it off, and again resumed my former attitude, Mr.
Petulengro said, &ldquo;I think enough has been done, brother, in
the affair of the old woman; I have, moreover, tried what you are
able to do, and find you, as I thought, less apt with the naked
mawleys than the stuffed gloves; nay, brother, put your hands
down, I&rsquo;m satisfied; blood has been shed, which is all that
can be reasonably expected for an old woman who carried so much
brimstone about her as Mrs. Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the struggle ended, and we resumed our route, Mr.
Petulengro sitting sideways upon his <!-- page 262--><a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>horse as
before, and I driving my little pony-cart, and when we had
proceeded about three miles, we came to a small public-house,
which bore the sign of the &ldquo;Silent Woman,&rdquo; where we
stopped to refresh our cattle and ourselves; and as we sat over
our bread and ale, it came to pass that Mr. Petulengro asked me
various questions, and amongst others, how I intended to dispose
of myself; I told him that I did not know; whereupon, with
considerable frankness, he invited me to his camp, and told me
that if I chose to settle down amongst them, and become a Rommany
chal, I should have his wife&rsquo;s sister Ursula, who was still
unmarried, and occasionally talked of me.</p>
<p>I declined his offer, assigning as a reason the recent death
of Mrs. Herne, of which I was the cause, although innocent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A pretty life I should lead with those two,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;when they came to know it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pooh,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;they will never
know it.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t blab, and as for Leonora, that girl
has a head on her shoulders.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Unlike the woman
in the sign,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whose head is cut off.&nbsp;
You speak nonsense, Mr. Petulengro; as long as a woman has a head
on her shoulders she&rsquo;ll talk,&mdash;but, leaving women out
of the case, it is impossible to keep anything a secret; an old
master of mine told me so long ago.&nbsp; I have moreover another
reason for declining your offer.&nbsp; I am at present not
disposed for society.&nbsp; I am become fond of solitude.&nbsp; I
wish I could find some quiet place to which I could retire to
hold communion with my own thoughts, and practise, if I thought
fit, either of my trades.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What trades?&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the one which I have
lately been engaged in, or my <!-- page 263--><a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>original
one, which I confess I should like better, that of a
kaulomescro.&rdquo; <a name="citation263"></a><a
href="#footnote263" class="citation">[263]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, I
have frequently heard you talk of making horse-shoes,&rdquo; said
Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;I, however, never saw you make one, and no
one else that I am aware; I don&rsquo;t believe&mdash;come,
brother, don&rsquo;t be angry, it&rsquo;s quite possible that you
may have done things which neither I nor any one else has seen
you do, and that such things may some day or other come to light,
as you say nothing can be kept secret.&nbsp; Be that, however, as
it may, pay the reckoning and let us be going; I think I can
advise you to just such a kind of place as you seem to
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know that I have got wherewithal to pay
the reckoning?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;I was just now looking in your face,
which exhibited the very look of a person conscious of the
possession of property; there was nothing hungry or sneaking in
it.&nbsp; Pay the reckoning, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when we were once more upon the road, Mr. Petulengro began
to talk of the place which he conceived would serve me as a
retreat under present circumstances.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you
frankly, brother, that it is a queer kind of place, and I am not
very fond of pitching my tent in it, it is so surprisingly
dreary.&nbsp; It is a deep dingle in the midst of a large field,
on an estate about which there has been a lawsuit for some years
past.&nbsp; I dare say you will be quiet enough, for the nearest
town is five miles distant, and there are only a few huts and
hedge public-houses in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Brother, I am
fond of solitude myself, but not that kind of solitude; I like a
quiet heath, where I can <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>pitch my
house, but I always like to have a gay stirring place not far
off, where the women can pen dukkerin, <a
name="citation264a"></a><a href="#footnote264a"
class="citation">[264a]</a> and I myself can sell or buy a horse,
if needful&mdash;such a place as the Chong Gav. <a
name="citation264b"></a><a href="#footnote264b"
class="citation">[264b]</a>&nbsp; I never feel so merry as when
there, brother, or on the heath above it, where I taught you
Rommany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after this discourse we reached a milestone, and a few
yards from the milestone, on the left hand, was a cross
road.&nbsp; Thereupon Mr. Petulengro said, &ldquo;Brother, my
path lies to the left; if you choose to go with me to my camp,
good; if not, Chal Devlehi.&rdquo; <a name="citation264c"></a><a
href="#footnote264c" class="citation">[264c]</a>&nbsp; But I
again refused Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s invitation, and, shaking him
by the hand, proceeded forward alone; and about ten miles farther
on I reached the town of which he had spoken, and, following
certain directions which he had given, discovered, though not
without some difficulty, the dingle which he had mentioned.&nbsp;
It was a deep hollow in the midst of a wide field; the shelving
sides were overgrown with trees and bushes, a belt of sallows
surrounded it on the top, a steep winding path led down into the
depths, practicable, however, for a light cart, like mine; at the
bottom was an open space, and there I pitched my tent, and there
I contrived to put up my forge.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will here ply the
trade of kaulomescro,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>Highly Poetical&mdash;Volundr&mdash;Grecian
Mythology&mdash;Making a Petul&mdash;Tongues of
Flame&mdash;Hammering&mdash;Spite of
Dukkerin&mdash;Heaviness.</p>
<p>It has always struck me that there is something highly
poetical about a forge.&nbsp; I am not singular in this opinion:
various individuals have assured me that they can never pass by
one, even in the midst of a crowded town, without experiencing
sensations which they can scarcely define, but which are highly
pleasurable.&nbsp; I have a decided penchant for forges,
especially rural ones, placed in some quaint quiet spot&mdash;a
dingle, for example, which is a poetical place, or at a meeting
of four roads, which is still more so; for how many a
superstition&mdash;and superstition is the soul of
poetry&mdash;is connected with these cross roads!&nbsp; I love to
light upon such a one, especially after night-fall, as everything
about a forge tells to most advantage at night; the hammer sounds
more solemnly in the stillness; the glowing particles scattered
by the strokes sparkle with more effect in the darkness, whilst
the sooty visage of the sastramescro, half in shadow, and half
illumed by the red and partial blaze of the forge, looks more
mysterious and strange.&nbsp; On such occasions I draw in my
horse&rsquo;s rein, and, seated in the saddle, endeavour to <!--
page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>associate with the picture before me&mdash;in itself a
picture of romance&mdash;whatever of the wild and wonderful I
have read of in books, or have seen with my own eyes in
connection with forges.</p>
<p>I believe the life of any blacksmith, especially a rural one,
would afford materials for a highly poetical history.&nbsp; I do
not speak unadvisedly, having the honour to be free of the forge,
and therefore fully competent to give an opinion as to what might
be made out of the forge by some dexterous hand.&nbsp; Certainly,
the strangest and most entertaining life ever written is that of
a blacksmith of the olden north, a certain Volundr, or Velint,
who lived in woods and thickets, made keen swords&mdash;so keen,
indeed, that if placed in a running stream, they would fairly
divide an object, however slight, which was borne against them by
the water, and who eventually married a king&rsquo;s daughter, by
whom he had a son, who was as bold a knight as his father was a
cunning blacksmith.&nbsp; I never see a forge at night, when
seated on the back of my horse, at the bottom of a dark lane, but
I somehow or other associate it with the exploits of this
extraordinary fellow, with many other extraordinary things,
amongst which, as I have hinted before, are particular passages
of my own life, one or two of which I shall perhaps relate to the
reader.</p>
<p>I never associate Vulcan and his Cyclops with the idea of a
forge.&nbsp; These gentry would be the very last people in the
world to flit across my mind whilst gazing at the forge from the
bottom of the dark lane.&nbsp; The truth is, they are highly
unpoetical fellows, as well they may be, connected as they are
with the Grecian mythology.&nbsp; At the <!-- page 267--><a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>very
mention of their names the forge burns dull and dim, as if
snowballs had been suddenly flung into it; the only remedy is to
ply the bellows, an operation which I now hasten to perform.</p>
<p>I am in the dingle making a horse-shoe.&nbsp; Having no other
horses on whose hoofs I could exercise my art, I made my first
essay on those of my own horse, if that could be called horse
which horse was none, being only a pony.&nbsp; Perhaps, if I had
sought all England, I should scarcely have found an animal more
in need of the kind offices of the smith.&nbsp; On three of his
feet there were no shoes at all, and on the fourth only a remnant
of one, on which account his hoofs were sadly broken and
lacerated by his late journeys over the hard and flinty
roads.&nbsp; &ldquo;You belonged to a tinker before,&rdquo; said
I, addressing the animal, &ldquo;but now you belong to a
smith.&nbsp; It is said that the household of the shoemaker
invariably go worse shod than that of any other craft.&nbsp; That
may be the case of those who make shoes of leather, but it
shan&rsquo;t be said of the household of him who makes shoes of
iron; at any rate it shan&rsquo;t be said of mine.&nbsp; I tell
you what, my gry, whilst you continue with me, you shall both be
better shod, and better fed, than you were with your last
master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am in the dingle making a petul; <a
name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a> and I must here observe, that whilst I
am making a horse-shoe, the reader need not be surprised if I
speak occasionally in the language of the lord of the
horse-shoe&mdash;Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; I have for some time past
been plying the peshota, or bellows, endeavouring to raise up the
yag, or fire, in my primitive forge.&nbsp; The angar, or coals,
are now <!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>burning fiercely, casting forth
sparks and long vagescoe chipes, <a name="citation268a"></a><a
href="#footnote268a" class="citation">[268a]</a> or tongues of
flame; a small bar of sastra, or iron, is lying in the fire, to
the length of ten or twelve inches, and so far it is hot, very
hot, exceeding hot, brother.&nbsp; And now you see me, prala, <a
name="citation268b"></a><a href="#footnote268b"
class="citation">[268b]</a> snatch the bar of iron, and place the
heated end of it upon the covantza, <a name="citation268c"></a><a
href="#footnote268c" class="citation">[268c]</a> or anvil, and
forthwith I commence cooring <a name="citation268d"></a><a
href="#footnote268d" class="citation">[268d]</a> the sastra as
hard as if I had been just engaged by a master at the rate of dui
caulor, or two shillings, a day, brother; and when I have beaten
the iron till it is nearly cool, and my arm tired, I place it
again in the angar, and begin again to rouse the fire with the
pudamengro, which signifies the blowing thing, and is another and
more common word for bellows; and whilst thus employed I sing a
Gypsy song, the sound of which is wonderfully in unison with the
hoarse moaning of the pudamengro, and ere the song is finished,
the iron is again hot and malleable.&nbsp; Behold, I place it
once more on the covantza, and recommence hammering; and now I am
somewhat at fault; I am in want of assistance; I want you,
brother, or some one else, to take the bar out of my hand and
support it upon the covantza, whilst I, applying a chinomescro,
or kind of chisel, to the heated iron, cut off with a lusty
stroke or two of the shukaro <a name="citation268e"></a><a
href="#footnote268e" class="citation">[268e]</a> baro, or big
hammer, as much as is required for the petul.&nbsp; But having no
one to help me, I go on hammering till I have fairly knocked off
as much as I want, and then I place the piece in the fire, and
again apply the bellows, <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>and take up
the song where I left it off; and when I have finished the song,
I take out the iron, but this time with my plaistra, or pincers,
and then I recommence hammering, turning the iron round and round
with my pincers: and now I bend the iron, and, lo and behold! it
has assumed something of the outline of a petul.</p>
<p>I am not going to enter into farther details with respect to
the process&mdash;it was rather a wearisome one.&nbsp; I had to
contend with various disadvantages; my forge was a rude one, my
tools might have been better; I was in want of one or two highly
necessary implements, but, above all, manual dexterity.&nbsp;
Though free of the forge, I had not practised the albeytarian art
for very many years, never since&mdash;but stay, it is not my
intention to tell the reader, at least in this place, how and
when I became a blacksmith.&nbsp; There was one thing, however,
which stood me in good stead in my labour, the same thing which
through life has ever been of incalculable utility to me, and has
not unfrequently supplied the place of friends, money, and many
other things of almost equal importance&mdash;iron perseverance,
without which all the advantages of time and circumstance are of
very little avail in any undertaking.&nbsp; I was determined to
make a horse-shoe, and a good one, in spite of every
obstacle&mdash;ay, in spite of dukkerin. <a
name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269"
class="citation">[269]</a>&nbsp; At the end of four days, during
which I had fashioned and refashioned the thing at least fifty
times, I had made a petul such as no master of the craft need
have been ashamed of; with the second shoe I had less difficulty,
and, by the time I had made the fourth, I would have scorned to
take off my hat to the best smith in Cheshire.</p>
<p><!-- page 270--><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>But I had not yet shod my little gry: this I proceeded
now to do.&nbsp; After having first well pared the hoofs with my
churi, <a name="citation270a"></a><a href="#footnote270a"
class="citation">[270a]</a> I applied each petul hot, glowing
hot, to the pindro. <a name="citation270b"></a><a
href="#footnote270b" class="citation">[270b]</a>&nbsp; Oh, how
the hoofs hissed! and, oh, the pleasant pungent odour which
diffused itself through the dingle!&mdash;an odour good for an
ailing spirit.</p>
<p>I shod the little horse bravely&mdash;merely pricked him once,
slightly, with a cafi, <a name="citation270c"></a><a
href="#footnote270c" class="citation">[270c]</a> for doing which,
I remember, he kicked me down; I was not disconcerted, however,
but, getting up, promised to be more cautious in future; and
having finished the operation, I filed the hoof well with the rin
baro, then dismissed him to graze amongst the trees, and, putting
my smaller tools into the muchtar, I sat down on my stone, and,
supporting my arm upon my knee, leaned my head upon my
hand.&nbsp; Heaviness had come over me.</p>

Father&rdquo;&mdash;Fellow-men&mdash;What a Mercy!&mdash;Almost
Calm&mdash;Fresh Store&mdash;History of Saul&mdash;Pitch
Dark.</p>
<p>Heaviness had suddenly come over me, heaviness of heart, and
of body also.&nbsp; I had accomplished the task which I had
imposed upon myself, and now that nothing more remained to do, my
energies suddenly deserted me, and I felt without strength, and
without hope.&nbsp; Several causes, perhaps, co-operated to bring
about the state in which I then felt myself.&nbsp; It is not
improbable that my energies had been overstrained during the work
the progress of which I have attempted to describe; and every one
is aware that the results of overstrained energies are feebleness
and lassitude&mdash;want of nourishment might likewise have
something to do with it.&nbsp; During my sojourn in the dingle,
my food had been of the simplest and most unsatisfying
description, by no means calculated to support the exertion which
the labour I had been engaged upon required; it had consisted of
coarse oaten cakes and hard cheese, and for beverage I had been
indebted to a neighbouring pit, in which, in the heat of the day,
I frequently saw, not golden <!-- page 272--><a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>or silver
fish, but frogs and efts swimming about.&nbsp; I am, however,
inclined to believe that Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s cake had quite as
much to do with the matter as insufficient nourishment.&nbsp; I
had never entirely recovered from the effects of its poison, but
had occasionally, especially at night, been visited by a grinding
pain in the stomach, and my whole body had been suffused with
cold sweat; and indeed these memorials of the drow have never
entirely disappeared&mdash;even at the present time they display
themselves in my system, especially after much fatigue of body
and excitement of mind.&nbsp; So there I sat in the dingle upon
my stone, nerveless and hopeless, by whatever cause or causes
that state had been produced&mdash;there I sat with my head
leaning upon my hand, and so I continued a long, long time.&nbsp;
At last I lifted my head from my hand, and began to cast anxious,
unquiet looks about the dingle&mdash;the entire hollow was now
enveloped in deep shade&mdash;I cast my eyes up; there was a
golden gleam on the tops of the trees which grew towards the
upper parts of the dingle; but lower down, all was gloom and
twilight&mdash;yet, when I first sat down on my stone, the sun
was right above the dingle, illuminating all its depths by the
rays which it cast perpendicularly down&mdash;so I must have sat
a long, long time upon my stone.&nbsp; And now, once more, I
rested my head upon my hand, but almost instantly lifted it again
in a kind of fear, and began looking at the objects before
me&mdash;the forge, the tools, the branches of the trees,
endeavouring to follow their rows, till they were lost in the
darkness of the dingle; and now I found my right hand grasping
convulsively the three fore fingers of the left, first
collectively, and then <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>successively, wringing them till the joints cracked;
then I became quiet, but not for long.</p>
<p>Suddenly I started up, and could scarcely repress the shriek
which was rising to my lips.&nbsp; Was it possible?&nbsp; Yes,
all too certain; the evil one was upon me; the inscrutable horror
which I had felt in my boyhood had once more taken possession of
me.&nbsp; I had thought that it had forsaken me&mdash;that it
would never visit me again; that I had outgrown it; that I might
almost bid defiance to it; and I had even begun to think of it
without horror, as we are in the habit of doing of horrors of
which we conceive we run no danger; and lo! when least thought
of, it had seized me again.&nbsp; Every moment I felt it
gathering force, and making me more wholly its own.&nbsp; What
should I do?&mdash;resist, of course; and I did resist.&nbsp; I
grasped, I tore, and strove to fling it from me; but of what
avail were my efforts?&nbsp; I could only have got rid of it by
getting rid of myself: it was a part of myself, or rather it was
all myself.&nbsp; I rushed amongst the trees, and struck at them
with my bare fists, and dashed my head against them, but I felt
no pain.&nbsp; How could I feel pain with that horror upon
me!&nbsp; And then I flung myself on the ground, gnawed the
earth, and swallowed it; and then I looked round; it was almost
total darkness in the dingle, and the darkness added to my
horror.&nbsp; I could no longer stay there; up I rose from the
ground, and attempted to escape.&nbsp; At the bottom of the
winding path which led up the acclivity I fell over something
which was lying on the ground; the something moved, and gave a
kind of whine.&nbsp; It was my little horse, which had made that
place its lair; my little horse; my only companion and <!-- page
274--><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>friend in that now awful solitude.&nbsp; I reached the
mouth of the dingle; the sun was just sinking in the far west
behind me, the fields were flooded with his last gleams.&nbsp;
How beautiful everything looked in the last gleams of the
sun!&nbsp; I felt relieved for a moment; I was no longer in the
horrid dingle.&nbsp; In another minute the sun was gone, and a
big cloud occupied the place where he had been: in a little time
it was almost as dark as it had previously been in the open part
of the dingle.&nbsp; My horror increased; what was I to
do?&mdash;it was of no use fighting against the horror&mdash;that
I saw; the more I fought against it, the stronger it
became.&nbsp; What should I do: say my prayers?&nbsp; Ah! why
not?&nbsp; So I knelt down under the hedge, and said, &ldquo;Our
Father&rdquo;; but that was of no use; and now I could no longer
repress cries&mdash;the horror was too great to be borne.&nbsp;
What should I do? run to the nearest town or village, and request
the assistance of my fellow-men?&nbsp; No! that I was ashamed to
do; notwithstanding the horror was upon me, I was ashamed to do
that.&nbsp; I knew they would consider me a maniac, if I went
screaming amongst them; and I did not wish to be considered a
maniac.&nbsp; Moreover, I knew that I was not a maniac, for I
possessed all my reasoning powers, only the horror was upon
me&mdash;the screaming horror!&nbsp; But how were indifferent
people to distinguish between madness and the screaming
horror?&nbsp; So I thought and reasoned; and at last I determined
not to go amongst my fellow-men, whatever the result might
be.&nbsp; I went to the mouth of the dingle, and there, placing
myself on my knees, I again said the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer; but it
was of no use&mdash;praying seemed to <!-- page 275--><a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>have no
effect over the horror; the unutterable fear appeared rather to
increase than diminish, and I again uttered wild cries, so loud
that I was apprehensive they would be heard by some chance
passenger on the neighbouring road; I therefore went deeper into
the dingle.&nbsp; I sat down with my back against a thorn bush;
the thorns entered my flesh, and when I felt them, I pressed
harder against the bush; I thought the pain of the flesh might in
some degree counteract the mental agony; presently I felt them no
longer&mdash;the power of the mental horror was so great that it
was impossible, with that upon me, to feel any pain from the
thorns.&nbsp; I continued in this posture a long time, undergoing
what I cannot describe, and would not attempt if I were
able.&nbsp; Several times I was on the point of starting up and
rushing anywhere; but I restrained myself, for I knew I could not
escape from myself, so why should I not remain in the
dingle?&nbsp; So I thought and said to myself, for my reasoning
powers were still uninjured.&nbsp; At last it appeared to me that
the horror was not so strong, not quite so strong upon me.&nbsp;
Was it possible that it was relaxing its grasp, releasing its
prey?&nbsp; Oh what a mercy! but it could not be; and yet&mdash;I
looked up to heaven, and clasped my hands, and said, &ldquo;Our
Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; I said no more&mdash;I was too agitated; and
now I was almost sure that the horror had done its worst.</p>
<p>After a little time I arose, and staggered down yet farther
into the dingle.&nbsp; I again found my little horse on the same
spot as before.&nbsp; I put my hand to his mouth&mdash;he licked
my hand.&nbsp; I flung myself down by him, and put my arms round
his neck; the creature whinnied, and appeared to sympathise <!--
page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>with me.&nbsp; What a comfort to have any one, even a
dumb brute, to sympathise with me at such a moment!&nbsp; I clung
to my little horse, as if for safety and protection.&nbsp; I laid
my head on his neck, and felt almost calm.&nbsp; Presently the
fear returned, but not so wild as before; it subsided, came
again, again subsided; then drowsiness came over me, and at last
I fell asleep, my head supported on the neck of the little
horse.&nbsp; I awoke; it was dark, dark night&mdash;not a star
was to be seen&mdash;but I felt no fear, the horror had left
me.&nbsp; I arose from the side of the little horse, and went
into my tent, lay down, and again went to sleep.</p>
<p>I awoke in the morning weak and sore, and shuddering at the
remembrance of what I had gone through on the preceding day; the
sun was shining brightly, but it had not yet risen high enough to
show its head above the trees which fenced the eastern side of
the dingle, on which account the dingle was wet and dank, from
the dews of the night.&nbsp; I kindled my fire, and, after
sitting by it for some time to warm my frame, I took some of the
coarse food which I have already mentioned; notwithstanding my
late struggle, and the coarseness of the fare, I ate with
appetite.&nbsp; My provisions had by this time been very much
diminished, and I saw that it would be speedily necessary, in the
event of my continuing to reside in the dingle, to lay in a fresh
store.&nbsp; After my meal, I went to the pit and filled a can
with water, which I brought to the dingle, and then again sat
down on my stone.&nbsp; I considered what I should next do: it
was necessary to do something, or my life in this solitude would
be insupportable.&nbsp; What should I do? rouse up my forge and
fashion a horse-shoe?&nbsp; But I wanted nerve <!-- page 277--><a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>and heart
for such an employment; moreover, I had no motive for fatiguing
myself in this manner; my own horse was shod, no other was at
hand, and it is hard to work for the sake of working.&nbsp; What
should I do? read?&nbsp; Yes, but I had no other book than the
Bible which the Welsh Methodist had given me.&nbsp; Well, why not
read the Bible?&nbsp; I was once fond of reading the Bible; ay,
but those days were long gone by.&nbsp; However, I did not see
what else I could well do on the present occasion&mdash;so I
determined to read the Bible&mdash;it was in Welsh; at any rate
it might amuse me.&nbsp; So I took the Bible out of the sack, in
which it was lying in the cart, and began to read at the place
where I chanced to open it.&nbsp; I opened it at that part where
the history of Saul commences.&nbsp; At first I read with
indifference, but after some time my attention was riveted, and
no wonder, I had come to the visitations of Saul&mdash;those dark
moments of his, when he did and said such unaccountable things;
it almost appeared to me that I was reading of myself; I, too,
had my visitations, dark as ever his were.&nbsp; Oh, how I
sympathised with Saul, the tall dark man!&nbsp; I had read his
life before, but it had made no impression on me; it had never
occurred to me that I was like him; but I now sympathised with
Saul, for my own dark hour was but recently passed, and, perhaps,
would soon return again; the dark hour came frequently on
Saul.</p>
<p>Time wore away; I finished the book of Saul, and, closing the
volume, returned it to its place.&nbsp; I then returned to my
seat on the stone, and thought of what I had read, and what I had
lately undergone.&nbsp; All at once I thought I felt well-known
sensations, a cramping of the breast, and a tingling <!-- page
278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>of
the soles of the feet; they were what I had felt on the preceding
day&mdash;they were the forerunners of the fear.&nbsp; I sat
motionless on my stone, the sensations passed away, and the fear
came not.&nbsp; Darkness was now coming again over the earth; the
dingle was again in deep shade; I roused the fire with the breath
of the bellows, and sat looking at the cheerful glow; it was
cheering and comforting.&nbsp; My little horse came now and lay
down on the ground beside the forge; I was not quite
deserted.&nbsp; I again ate some of the coarse food, and drank
plentifully of the water which I had fetched in the
morning.&nbsp; I then put fresh fuel on the fire, and sat for a
long time looking on the blaze; I then went into my tent.</p>
<p>I awoke, on my own calculation, about midnight&mdash;it was
pitch dark, and there was much fear upon me.</p>

<p>Two mornings after the period to which I have brought the
reader in the preceding chapter, I sat by my fire at the bottom
of the dingle; I had just breakfasted, and had finished the last
morsel of food which I had brought with me to that solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I now do?&rdquo; said I to myself;
&ldquo;shall I continue here, or decamp?&mdash;this is a sad
lonely spot&mdash;perhaps I had better quit it; but whither shall
I go? the wide world is before me, but what can I do
therein?&nbsp; I have been in the world already without much
success.&nbsp; No, I had better remain here; the place is lonely,
it is true, but here I am free and independent, and can do what I
please; but I can&rsquo;t remain here without food.&nbsp; Well, I
will find my way to the nearest town, lay in a fresh supply of
provision, and come back, turning my back upon the world, which
has turned its back upon me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why I should
not write a little sometimes; I have pens <!-- page 280--><a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>and an
ink-horn, and for a writing-desk I can place the Bible on my
knee.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I could write a capital
satire on the world on the back of that Bible; but, first of all,
I must think of supplying myself with food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rose up from the stone on which I was seated, determining to
go to the nearest town, with my little horse and cart, and
procure what I wanted.&nbsp; The nearest town, according to my
best calculation, lay about five miles distant; I had no doubt,
however, that, by using ordinary diligence, I should be back
before evening.&nbsp; In order to go lighter, I determined to
leave my tent standing as it was, and all the things which I had
purchased of the tinker, just as they were.&nbsp; &ldquo;I need
not be apprehensive on their account,&rdquo; said I to myself;
&ldquo;nobody will come here to meddle with them&mdash;the great
recommendation of this place is its perfect solitude&mdash;I dare
say that I could live here six months without seeing a single
human visage.&nbsp; I will now harness my little gry and be off
to the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a whistle which I gave, the little gry, <a
name="citation280"></a><a href="#footnote280"
class="citation">[280]</a> which was feeding on the bank near the
uppermost part of the dingle, came running to me, for by this
time he had become so accustomed to me, that he would obey my
call, for all the world as if he had been one of the canine
species.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;we are
going to the town to buy bread for myself, and oats for
you&mdash;I am in a hurry to be back; therefore, I pray you to do
your best, and to draw me and the cart to the town with all
possible speed, and to bring us back; if you do your best, I
promise you oats on your return.&nbsp; You know the meaning of
oats, Ambrol?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>Ambrol whinnied as if to let me know that he understood
me perfectly well, as indeed he well might, as I had never once
fed him during the time that he had been in my possession without
saying the word in question to him.&nbsp; Now, Ambrol, in the
Gypsy tongue, signifieth a pear.</p>
<p>So I caparisoned Ambrol, and then, going to the cart, I
removed two or three things from it into the tent; I then lifted
up the shafts, and was just going to call to the pony to come and
be fastened to them, when I thought I heard a noise.</p>
<p>I stood stock still, supporting the shaft of the little cart
in my hand, and bending the right side of my face slightly
towards the ground, but I could hear nothing; the noise which I
thought I had heard was not one of those sounds which I was
accustomed to hear in that solitude&mdash;the note of a bird, or
the rustling of a bough; it was&mdash;there I heard it again, a
sound very much resembling the grating of a wheel amongst
gravel.&nbsp; Could it proceed from the road?&nbsp; Oh no, the
road was too far distant for me to hear the noise of anything
moving along it.&nbsp; Again I listened, and now I distinctly
heard the sound of wheels, which seemed to be approaching the
dingle; nearer and nearer they drew, and presently the sound of
wheels was blended with the murmur of voices.&nbsp; Anon I heard
a boisterous shout, which seemed to proceed from the entrance of
the dingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here are folks at hand,&rdquo; said I,
letting the shaft of the cart fall to the ground, &ldquo;is it
possible that they can be coming here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My doubts on that point, if I entertained any, were soon
dispelled; the wheels, which had ceased moving for a moment or
two, were once again in <!-- page 282--><a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>motion, and
were now evidently moving down the winding path which led to my
retreat.&nbsp; Leaving my cart, I came forward and placed myself
near the entrance of the open space, with my eyes fixed on the
path down which my unexpected, and I may say unwelcome, visitors
were coming.&nbsp; Presently I heard a stamping or sliding, as if
of a horse in some difficulty; then a loud curse, and the next
moment appeared a man and a horse and cart; the former holding
the head of the horse up to prevent him from falling, of which he
was in danger, owing to the precipitous nature of the path.&nbsp;
Whilst thus occupied, the head of the man was averted from
me.&nbsp; When, however, he had reached the bottom of the
descent, he turned his head, and perceiving me, as I stood
bareheaded, without either coat or waistcoat, about two yards
from him, he gave a sudden start, so violent, that the backward
motion of his hand had nearly flung the horse upon his
haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you move forward?&rdquo; said a voice
from behind, apparently that of a female; &ldquo;you are stopping
up the way, and we shall be all down upon one another;&rdquo; and
I saw the head of another horse overtopping the back of the
cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you move forward, Jack?&rdquo; said
another voice, also of a female, yet higher up the path.</p>
<p>The man stirred not, but remained staring at me in the posture
which he had assumed on first perceiving me, his body very much
drawn back, his left foot far in advance of his right, and with
his right hand still grasping the halter of the horse, which gave
way more and more, till it was clean down on its haunches.</p>
<p><!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the voice
which I had last heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back with you, Belle, Moll,&rdquo; said the man,
still staring at me, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something not over canny
or comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the same voice; &ldquo;let me
pass, Moll, and I&rsquo;ll soon clear the way;&rdquo; and I heard
a kind of rushing down the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid,&rdquo; said I, addressing
myself to the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean you no harm; I am a
wanderer like yourself&mdash;come here to seek for
shelter&mdash;you need not be afraid; I am a Roman chabo <a
name="citation283"></a><a href="#footnote283"
class="citation">[283]</a> by matriculation&mdash;one of the
right sort, and no mistake&mdash;Good day to ye, brother; I bid
ye welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man eyed me suspiciously for a moment&mdash;then, turning
to his horse with a loud curse, he pulled him up from his
haunches, and led him and the cart farther down to one side of
the dingle, muttering, as he passed me, &ldquo;Afraid!&nbsp;
Hm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not remember ever to have seen a more ruffianly looking
fellow; he was about six feet high, with an immensely athletic
frame; his face was black and bluff, and sported an immense pair
of whiskers, but with here and there a grey hair, for his age
could not be much under fifty.&nbsp; He wore a faded blue
frock-coat, corduroys, and highlows; on his black head was a kind
of red nightcap, round his bull neck a Barcelona
handkerchief&mdash;I did not like the look of the man at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; growled the fellow, proceeding to
unharness his horse; &ldquo;that was the word, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But other figures were now already upon the scene.&nbsp;
Dashing past the other horse and cart, <!-- page 284--><a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>which by
this time had reached the bottom of the pass, appeared an
exceedingly tall woman, or rather girl, for she could scarcely
have been above eighteen; she was dressed in a tight bodice and a
blue stuff gown; hat, bonnet, or cap she had none, and her hair,
which was flaxen, hung down on her shoulders unconfined; her
complexion was fair, and her features handsome, with a determined
but open expression&mdash;she was followed by another female,
about forty, stout and vulgar looking, at whom I scarcely
glanced, my whole attention being absorbed by the tall girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jack?&rdquo; said the latter,
looking at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only afraid, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said the man,
still proceeding with his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid at what&mdash;at that lad? why, he looks like a
ghost&mdash;I would engage to thrash him with one
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might beat me with no hands at all,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;fair damsel, only by looking at me&mdash;I never saw such
a face and figure, both regal&mdash;why, you look like Ingeborg,
Queen of Norway; she had twelve brothers, you know, and could
lick them all, though they were heroes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;On Dovrefeld in Norway,<br />
Were once together seen,<br />
The twelve heroic brothers<br />
Of Ingeborg the queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;None of your chaffing, young fellow,&rdquo; said the
tall girl, &ldquo;or I will give you what shall make you wipe
your face; be civil, or you will rue it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I was a peg too high,&rdquo; said <!--
page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>I; &ldquo;I ask your pardon&mdash;here&rsquo;s
something a bit lower:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As I was jawing to the gav yeck divvus<br
/>
I met on the drom miro Rommany chi&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285"
class="citation">[285]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;None of your Rommany chies, young fellow,&rdquo; said
the tall girl, looking more menacingly than before, and clenching
her fist; &ldquo;you had better be civil, I am none of your
chies; and though I keep company with Gypsies, or, to speak more
proper, half-and-halfs, I would have you to know that I come of
Christian blood and parents, and was born in the great house of
Long Melford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that it was a
great house; judging from your size I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if
you were born in a church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, Belle,&rdquo; said the man, putting himself
before the young virago, who was about to rush upon me, &ldquo;my
turn is first&rdquo;&mdash;then, advancing to me in a menacing
attitude, he said, with a look of deep malignity,
&ldquo;&lsquo;Afraid&rsquo; was the word, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I think I wronged
you; I should have said, aghast, you exhibited every symptom of
one labouring under uncontrollable fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow stared at me with a look of stupid ferocity, and
appeared to be hesitating whether to strike or not: ere he could
make up his mind, the tall girl started forward, crying,
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s chaffing; let me at him;&rdquo; and before I
could put myself on my guard, she struck me a blow on the face
which had nearly brought me to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; said I, putting my hand to my cheek;
&ldquo;you have now performed your promise, <!-- page 286--><a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>and made me
wipe my face: now be pacified, and tell me fairly the grounds of
this quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grounds!&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
you say I was afraid; and if you hadn&rsquo;t, who gave you leave
to camp on my ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your ground?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty question,&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;as if
all the world didn&rsquo;t know that.&nbsp; Do you know who I
am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;unless I am much
mistaken, you are he whom folks call the &lsquo;Flaming
Tinman.&rsquo;&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m glad we
have met, for I wished to see you.&nbsp; These are your two
wives, I suppose; I greet them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no harm
done&mdash;there&rsquo;s room enough here for all of us&mdash;we
shall soon be good friends, I dare say; and when we are a little
better acquainted, I&rsquo;ll tell you my history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if that doesn&rsquo;t beat all!&rdquo; said the
fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s chaffing now,&rdquo;
said the girl, whose anger seemed to have subsided on a sudden;
&ldquo;the young man speaks civil enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Civil!&rdquo; said the fellow, with an oath; &ldquo;but
that&rsquo;s just like you; with you it is a blow, and all
over.&nbsp; Civil!&nbsp; I suppose you would have him stay here,
and get into all my secrets, and hear all I may have to say to my
two morts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two morts!&rdquo; said the girl, kindling up,
&ldquo;where are they?&nbsp; Speak for one, and no more.&nbsp; I
am no mort of yours, whatever some one else may be.&nbsp; I tell
you one thing, Black John, or Anselo,&mdash;for t&rsquo;other
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t your name,&mdash;the same thing I told the
young man here, be civil, or you will rue it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fellow looked at the girl furiously, but his <!-- page
287--><a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>glance soon quailed before hers; he withdrew his eyes,
and cast them on my little horse, which was feeding amongst the
trees.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said he, rushing
forward and seizing the animal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, as I am alive,
this is the horse of that mumping villain Slingsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his no longer; I bought it and paid for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine now,&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;I
swore I would seize it the next time I found it on my beat; ay,
and beat the master too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not Slingsby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All&rsquo;s one for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say you will beat me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid was the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick and feeble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up your fists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the horse satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horse nor bellows either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mercy, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your eyes, Jack.&nbsp; There, you&rsquo;ve got
it.&nbsp; I thought so,&rdquo; shouted the girl, as the fellow
staggered back from a sharp blow in the eye; &ldquo;I thought he
was chaffing at you all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Anselo.&nbsp; You know what to do&mdash;go
in,&rdquo; said the vulgar woman, who had hitherto not spoken a
word, but who now came forward with all the look of a fury;
&ldquo;go inapopli; <a name="citation287"></a><a
href="#footnote287" class="citation">[287]</a> you&rsquo;ll smash
ten like he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Flaming Tinman took her advice, and came in bent on
smashing, but stopped short on receiving a left-handed blow on
the nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never beat the Flaming Tinman in that
way,&rdquo; said the girl, looking at me doubtfully.</p>
<p><!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>And so I began to think myself, when, in the twinkling
of an eye, the Flaming Tinman, disengaging himself of his
frock-coat, and dashing off his red nightcap, came rushing in
more desperately than ever.&nbsp; To a flush hit which he
received in the mouth he paid as little attention as a wild bull
would have done; in a moment his arms were around me, and in
another he had hurled me down, falling heavily upon me.&nbsp; The
fellow&rsquo;s strength appeared to be tremendous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay him off now,&rdquo; said the vulgar woman.&nbsp;
The Flaming Tinman made no reply, but, planting his knee on my
breast, seized my throat with two huge horny hands.&nbsp; I gave
myself up for dead, and probably should have been so in another
minute but for the tall girl, who caught hold of the handkerchief
which the fellow wore round his neck, with a grasp nearly as
powerful as that with which he pressed my throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call that fair play?&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands off, Belle,&rdquo; said the other woman;
&ldquo;do you call it fair play to interfere? hands off, or
I&rsquo;ll be down upon you myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Belle paid no heed to the injunction, and tugged so hard
at the handkerchief, that the Flaming Tinman was nearly
throttled; suddenly relinquishing his hold of me, he started on
his feet, and aimed a blow at my fair preserver, who avoided it,
but said coolly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish t&rsquo;other business first, and then I&rsquo;m
your woman whenever you like; but finish it fairly&mdash;no foul
play when I&rsquo;m by&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be the boy&rsquo;s
second, and Moll can pick up you when he happens to knock you
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle during the next ten minutes raged <!-- page
289--><a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>with considerable fury, but it so happened that during
this time I was never able to knock the Flaming Tinman down, but
on the contrary received six knock-down blows myself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can never stand this,&rdquo; said I, as I sat on the
knee of Belle, &ldquo;I am afraid I must give in; the Flaming
Tinman hits very hard,&rdquo; and I spat out a mouthful of
blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure enough you&rsquo;ll never beat the Flaming Tinman
in the way you fight&mdash;it&rsquo;s of no use flipping at the
Flaming Tinman with your left hand; why don&rsquo;t you use your
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m not handy with it,&rdquo; said I; and
then getting up, I once more confronted the Flaming Tinman, and
struck him six blows for his one, but they were all left-handed
blows, and the blow which the Flaming Tinman gave me knocked me
off my legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, will you use Long Melford?&rdquo; said Belle,
picking me up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by Long
Melford,&rdquo; said I, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this long right of yours,&rdquo; said Belle,
feeling my right arm; &ldquo;if you do, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
if you yet stand a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the Flaming Tinman was once more ready, much more
ready than myself.&nbsp; I, however, rose from my second&rsquo;s
knee as well as my weakness would permit me.&nbsp; On he came,
striking left and right, appearing almost as fresh as to wind and
spirit as when he first commenced the combat, though his eyes
were considerably swelled, and his nether lip was cut in two; on
he came, striking left and right, and I did not like his blows at
all, or even the wind of them, which <!-- page 290--><a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>was
anything but agreeable, and I gave way before him.&nbsp; At last
he aimed a blow which, had it taken full effect, would doubtless
have ended the battle, but owing to his slipping, the fist only
grazed my left shoulder, and came with terrific force against a
tree, close to which I had been driven; before the Tinman could
recover himself, I collected all my strength, and struck him
beneath the ear, and then fell to the ground completely
exhausted; and it so happened that the blow which I struck the
tinker beneath the ear was a right-handed blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Long Melford!&rdquo; I heard Belle exclaim;
&ldquo;there is nothing like Long Melford for shortness, all the
world over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words I turned round my head as I lay, and perceived
the Flaming Tinman stretched upon the ground apparently
senseless.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; said the vulgar woman,
as she vainly endeavoured to raise him up; &ldquo;he is dead; the
best man in all the north country, killed in this fashion, by a
boy!&rdquo;&nbsp; Alarmed at these words, I made shift to get on
my feet; and, with the assistance of the woman, placed my fallen
adversary in a sitting posture.&nbsp; I put my hand to his heart,
and felt a slight pulsation&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not
dead,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;only stunned; if he were let blood,
he would recover presently.&rdquo;&nbsp; I produced a penknife
which I had in my pocket, and, baring the arm of the Tinman, was
about to make the necessary incision, when the woman gave me a
violent blow, and, pushing me aside, exclaimed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
tear the eyes out of your head, if you offer to touch him.&nbsp;
Do you want to complete your work, and murder him outright, now
he&rsquo;s asleep? you have had enough of <!-- page 291--><a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>his blood
already.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are mad,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
only seek to do him service.&nbsp; Well, if you won&rsquo;t let
him be blooded, fetch some water and fling it in his face; you
know where the pit is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty man&oelig;uvre!&rdquo; said the woman;
&ldquo;leave my husband in the hands of you and that limmer, who
has never been true to us&mdash;I should find him strangled or
his throat cut when I came back.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
go,&rdquo; said I to the tall girl; &ldquo;take the can and fetch
some water from the pit.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better go
yourself,&rdquo; said the girl, wiping a tear as she looked on
the yet senseless form of the tinker; &ldquo;you had better go
yourself, if you think water will do him good.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had
by this time somewhat recovered my exhausted powers, and, taking
the can, I bent my steps as fast as I could to the pit; arriving
there, I lay down on the brink, took a long draught, and then
plunged my head into the water; after which I filled the can, and
bent my way back to the dingle.&nbsp; Before I could reach the
path which led down into its depths, I had to pass some way along
its side; I had arrived at a part immediately over the scene of
the last encounter, where the bank, overgrown with trees, sloped
precipitously down.&nbsp; Here I heard a loud sound of voices in
the dingle; I stopped, and laying hold of a tree, leaned over the
bank and listened.&nbsp; The two women appeared to be in hot
dispute in the dingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was all owing to you, you
limmer,&rdquo; said the vulgar woman to the other; &ldquo;had you
not interfered, the old man would soon have settled the
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for fair play and Long Melford,&rdquo; said
the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your old man, as you call him, could
have settled the boy fairly, he might for all <!-- page 292--><a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>I should
have cared, but no foul work for me; and as for sticking the boy
with our gulleys when he comes back, as you proposed, I am not so
fond of your old man or you that I should oblige you in it, to my
soul&rsquo;s destruction.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold your tongue,
or I&rsquo;ll . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; I listened no farther, but
hastened as fast as I could to the dingle.&nbsp; My adversary had
just begun to show signs of animation; the vulgar woman was still
supporting him, and occasionally cast glances of anger at the
tall girl, who was walking slowly up and down.&nbsp; I lost no
time in dashing the greater part of the water into the
Tinman&rsquo;s face, whereupon he sneezed, moved his hands, and
presently looked round him.&nbsp; At first his looks were dull
and heavy, and without any intelligence at all; he soon, however,
began to recollect himself, and to be conscious of his situation;
he cast a scowling glance at me, then one of the deepest
malignity at the tall girl, who was still walking about without
taking much notice of what was going forward.&nbsp; At last he
looked at his right hand, which had evidently suffered from the
blow against the tree, and a half-stifled curse escaped his
lips.&nbsp; The vulgar woman now said something to him in a low
tone, whereupon he looked at her for a moment, and then got upon
his legs.&nbsp; Again the vulgar woman said something to him; her
looks were furious, and she appeared to be urging him on to
attempt something.&nbsp; I observed that she had a clasped knife
in her hand.&nbsp; The fellow remained standing for some time as
if hesitating what to do; at last he looked at his hand, and,
shaking his head, said something to the woman which I did not
understand.&nbsp; The tall girl, however, appeared to overhear
him, and, <!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>probably repeating his words, said,
&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t do; you are right there; and now hear
what I have to say,&mdash;let bygones be bygones, and let us all
shake hands, and camp here, as the young man was saying just
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man looked at her, and then, without any
reply, went to his horse, which was lying down among the trees,
and kicking it up, led it to the cart, to which he forthwith
began to harness it.&nbsp; The other cart and horse had remained
standing motionless during the whole affair which I have been
recounting, at the bottom of the pass.&nbsp; The woman now took
the horse by the head, and leading it with the cart into the open
part of the dingle, turned both round, and then led them back,
till the horse and cart had mounted a little way up the ascent;
she then stood still and appeared to be expecting the man.&nbsp;
During this proceeding Belle had stood looking on without saying
anything; at last, perceiving that the man had harnessed his
horse to the other cart, and that both he and the woman were
about to take their departure, she said, &ldquo;You are not
going, are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Receiving no answer, she continued:
&ldquo;I tell you what, both of you, Black John, and you Moll,
his mort, <a name="citation293"></a><a href="#footnote293"
class="citation">[293]</a> this is not treating me over
civilly,&mdash;however, I am ready to put up with it, and to go
with you if you like, for I bear no malice.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry
for what has happened, but you have only yourselves to thank for
it.&nbsp; Now, shall I go with you, only tell me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The man made no manner of reply, but flogged his horse.&nbsp; The
woman, however, whose passions were probably under less control,
replied, with a screeching tone, &ldquo;Stay where you are, you
jade, and may the curse of Judas cling to you,&mdash;stay with
the bit of a <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>mullo <a name="citation294a"></a><a

and my only hope is that he may gulley <a

you with us, indeed! after what&rsquo;s past! no, nor nothing
belonging to you.&nbsp; Fetch down your mailla <a
name="citation294c"></a><a href="#footnote294c"
class="citation">[294c]</a> go-cart and live here with your
chabo.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then whipped on the horse, and ascended
the pass, followed by the man.&nbsp; The carts were light, and
they were not long in ascending the winding path.&nbsp; I
followed to see that they took their departure.&nbsp; Arriving at
the top, I found near the entrance a small donkey-cart, which I
concluded belonged to the girl.&nbsp; The tinker and his mort
were already at some distance; I stood looking after them for a
little time, then taking the donkey by the reins I led it with
the cart to the bottom of the dingle.&nbsp; Arrived there, I
found Belle seated on the stone by the fireplace.&nbsp; Her hair
was all dishevelled, and she was in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were bad people,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I did
not like them, but they were my only acquaintance in the wide
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Tea&mdash;Vapours&mdash;Isopel Berners&mdash;Softly and
Kindly&mdash;Sweet Pretty Creature&mdash;Bread and
Water&mdash;Two Sailors&mdash;Truth and Constancy&mdash;Very
Strangely.</p>
<p>In the evening of that same day the tall girl and I sat at tea
by the fire, at the bottom of the dingle; the girl on a small
stool, and myself, as usual, upon my stone.</p>
<p>The water which served for the tea had been taken from a
spring of pellucid water in the neighbourhood, which I had not
had the good fortune to discover, though it was well known to my
companion, and to the wandering people who frequented the
dingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This tea is very good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I
cannot enjoy it as much as if I were well: I feel very
sadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else should you feel,&rdquo; said the girl,
&ldquo;after fighting with the Flaming Tinman?&nbsp; All I wonder
at is that you can feel at all!&nbsp; As for the tea, it ought to
be good, seeing that it cost me ten shillings a pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great deal for a person in your station
to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my station!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have you to know, young
man&mdash;however, I haven&rsquo;t the heart to quarrel with you,
you look so ill; and after all, it is a good sum <!-- page
296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>for one to pay who travels the roads; but if I must
have tea, I like to have the best; and tea I must have, for I am
used to it, though I can&rsquo;t help thinking that it sometimes
fills my head with strange fancies&mdash;what some folks call
vapours, making me weep and cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should never have
thought that one of your size and fierceness would weep and
cry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My size and fierceness!&nbsp; I tell you what, young
man, you are not over civil this evening; but you are ill, as I
said before, and I shan&rsquo;t take much notice of your
language, at least for the present; as for my size, I am not so
much bigger than yourself; and as for being fierce, you should be
the last one to fling that at me.&nbsp; It is well for you that I
can be fierce sometimes.&nbsp; If I hadn&rsquo;t taken your part
against Blazing Bosville, you wouldn&rsquo;t be now taking tea
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that you struck me in the face first; but
we&rsquo;ll let that pass.&nbsp; So that man&rsquo;s name is
Bosville; what&rsquo;s your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isopel Berners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, young man, you seem fond of asking questions:
will you have another cup of tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to ask for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, here it is, and much good may it do you; as
for my name, I got it from my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s name, then, was Isopel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isopel Berners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But had you never a father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had a father,&rdquo; said the girl, sighing,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t bear his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>&ldquo;Is it the fashion, then, in your country for
children to bear their mother&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask such questions, young man, I shall be angry
with you.&nbsp; I have told you my name, and, whether my
father&rsquo;s or mother&rsquo;s, I am not ashamed of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a noble name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are right, young man.&nbsp; The chaplain in
the great house, where I was born, told me it was a noble name;
it was odd enough, he said, that the only three noble names in
the county were to be found in the great house; mine was one; the
other two were Devereux and Bohun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by the great house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that you were born there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, young man; and as you now speak softly and kindly,
I will tell you my whole tale.&nbsp; My father was an officer of
the sea, and was killed at sea as he was coming home to marry my
mother, Isopel Berners.&nbsp; He had been acquainted with her,
and had left her; but after a few months he wrote her a letter,
to say that he had no rest, and that he repented, and that as
soon as his ship came to port he would do her all the reparation
in his power.&nbsp; Well, young man, the very day before they
reached port they met the enemy, and there was a fight, and my
father was killed, after he had struck down six of the
enemy&rsquo;s crew on their own deck; for my father was a big
man, as I have heard, and knew tolerably well how to use his
hands.&nbsp; And when my mother heard the news, she became half
distracted, and ran away into the fields and forests, totally
neglecting her business, for she was a small milliner; and so she
ran demented about the meads <!-- page 298--><a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>and forests
for a long time, now sitting under a tree, and now by the side of
a river&mdash;at last she flung herself into some water, and
would have been drowned, had not some one been at hand and
rescued her, whereupon she was conveyed to the great house, lest
she should attempt to do herself farther mischief, for she had
neither friends nor parents&mdash;and there she died three months
after, having first brought me into the world.&nbsp; She was a
sweet pretty creature, I&rsquo;m told, but hardly fit for this
world, being neither large, nor fierce, nor able to take her own
part.&nbsp; So I was born and bred in the great house, where I
learnt to read and sew, to fear God, and to take my own
part.&nbsp; When I was fourteen I was put out to service to a
small farmer and his wife, with whom, however, I did not stay
long, for I was half starved, and otherwise ill-treated,
especially by my mistress, who one day attempting to knock me
down with a besom, I knocked her down with my fist, and went back
to the great house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did they receive you in the great
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very kindly, young man&mdash;on the contrary, I was
put into a dark room, where I was kept a fortnight on bread and
water; I did not much care, however, being glad to have got back
to the great house at any rate&mdash;the place where I was born,
and where my poor mother died; and in the great house I continued
two years longer, reading and sewing, fearing God, and taking my
own part when necessary.&nbsp; At the end of the two years I was
again put out to service, but this time to a rich farmer and his
wife, with whom, however, I did not live long, less time, I
believe, than with the poor ones, being obliged to leave
for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>&ldquo;Knocking your mistress down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, young man, knocking my master down, who conducted
himself improperly towards me.&nbsp; This time I did not go back
to the great house, having a misgiving that they would not
receive me; so I turned my back to the great house where I was
born, and where my poor mother died, and wandered for several
days I know not whither, supporting myself on a few halfpence
which I chanced to have in my pocket.&nbsp; It happened one day,
as I sat under a hedge crying, having spent my last farthing,
that a comfortable-looking elderly woman came up in a cart, and
seeing the state in which I was, she stopped and asked what was
the matter with me; I told her some part of my story, whereupon
she said, &lsquo;Cheer up, my dear; if you like, you shall go
with me, and wait upon me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course I wanted little
persuasion, so I got into the cart and went with her.&nbsp; She
took me to London and various other places, and I soon found that
she was a travelling woman, who went about the country with silks
and linen.&nbsp; I was of great use to her, more especially in
those places where we met evil company.&nbsp; Once, as we were
coming from Dover, we were met by two sailors, who stopped our
cart, and would have robbed and stripped us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Let me
get down,&rsquo; said I; so I got down, and fought with them
both, till they turned round and ran away.&nbsp; Two years I
lived with the old gentlewoman, who was very kind to me, almost
as kind as a mother; at last she fell sick at a place in
Lincolnshire, and after a few days died, leaving me her cart and
stock in trade, praying me only to see her decently
buried&mdash;which I did, giving her a funeral fit for a
gentlewoman.&nbsp; After which I travelled the country&mdash;<!--
page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>melancholy enough for want of company, but so far
fortunate, that I could take my own part when anybody was uncivil
to me.&nbsp; At last, passing through the valley of Todmorden, I
formed the acquaintance of Blazing Bosville and his wife, with
whom I occasionally took journeys for company&rsquo;s sake, for
it is melancholy to travel about alone, even when one can take
one&rsquo;s own part.&nbsp; I soon found they were evil people;
but, upon the whole, they treated me civilly, and I sometimes
lent them a little money, so that we got on tolerably well
together.&nbsp; He and I, it is true, had once a dispute, and
nearly came to blows; for once, when we were alone, he wanted me
to marry him, promising, if I would, to turn off Grey Moll, or,
if I liked it better, to make her wait upon me as a maid-servant;
I never liked him much, but from that hour less than ever.&nbsp;
Of the two, I believe Grey Moll to be the best, for she is at any
rate true and faithful to him, and I like truth and
constancy&mdash;don&rsquo;t you, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;they are very nice
things.&nbsp; I feel very strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you feel, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid, at what?&nbsp; At the Flaming Tinman?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be afraid of him.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t come back, and
if he did, he shouldn&rsquo;t touch you in this state; I&rsquo;d
fight him for you; but he won&rsquo;t come back, so you
needn&rsquo;t be afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of the Flaming Tinman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, are you afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil one!&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heed,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
stand by you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hubbub of Voices&mdash;No Offence&mdash;Nodding&mdash;The
Guests.</p>
<p>The kitchen of the public-house was a large one, and many
people were drinking in it; there was a confused hubbub of
voices.</p>
<p>I sat down on a bench behind a deal table, of which there were
three or four in the kitchen; presently a bulky man, in a green
coat of the Newmarket cut, and without a hat, entered, and
observing me, came up, and in rather a gruff tone cried,
&ldquo;Want anything, young fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me a jug of ale,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you are
the master, as I suppose you are, by that same coat of yours, and
your having no hat on your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be saucy, young fellow,&rdquo; said the
landlord, for such he was; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be saucy, or . . .
&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever he intended to say he left unsaid, for
fixing his eyes upon one of my hands, which I had placed by
chance upon the table, he became suddenly still.</p>
<p>This was my left hand, which was raw and swollen, from the
blows dealt on a certain hard skull in a recent combat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you mean by staring at my hand so?&rdquo; said I,
withdrawing it from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offence, young man, no offence,&rdquo; said the <!--
page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
302</span>landlord, in a quite altered tone; &ldquo;but the sight
of your hand . . . &rdquo; then observing that our conversation
began to attract the notice of the guests in the kitchen, he
interrupted himself, saying in an undertone, &ldquo;But
mum&rsquo;s the word for the present, I will go and fetch the
ale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In about a minute he returned, with a jug of ale foaming
high.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your health,&rdquo; said he,
blowing off the foam, and drinking; but perceiving that I looked
rather dissatisfied, he murmured, &ldquo;All&rsquo;s right, I
glory in you; but mum&rsquo;s the word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then placing
the jug on the table, he gave me a confidential nod, and
swaggered out of the room.</p>
<p>What can the silly impertinent fellow mean, thought I; but the
ale was now before me, and I hastened to drink, for my weakness
was great, and my mind was full of dark thoughts, the remains of
the indescribable horror of the preceding night.&nbsp; It may
kill me, thought I, as I drank deep&mdash;but who cares? anything
is better than what I have suffered.&nbsp; I drank deep, and then
leaned back against the wall: it appeared as if a vapour was
stealing up into my brain, gentle and benign, soothing and
stilling the horror and the fear; higher and higher it mounted,
and I felt nearly overcome; but the sensation was delicious,
compared with that I had lately experienced, and now I felt
myself nodding; and, bending down, I laid my head on the table on
my folded hands.</p>
<p>And in that attitude I remained some time, perfectly
unconscious.&nbsp; At length, by degrees, perception returned,
and I lifted up my head.&nbsp; I felt somewhat dizzy and
bewildered, but the dark shadow had withdrawn itself from
me.&nbsp; And now once more I drank of the jug; this second
draught <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>did not produce an overpowering
effect upon me&mdash;it revived and strengthened me&mdash;I felt
a new man.</p>
<p>I looked around me; the kitchen had been deserted by the
greater part of the guests; besides myself, only four remained;
these were seated at the farther end.&nbsp; One was haranguing
fiercely and eagerly; he was abusing England, and praising
America.&nbsp; At last he exclaimed, &ldquo;So when I gets to New
York, I will toss up my hat, and damn the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That man must be a Radical, thought I.</p>

York&mdash;Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle&mdash;No Wish to
Fight&mdash;First Draught&mdash;A Poor Pipe&mdash;Half-a-crown
Broke.</p>
<p>The individual whom I supposed to be a Radical, after a short
pause, again uplifted his voice; he was rather a strong-built
fellow of about thirty, with an ill-favoured countenance, a white
hat on his head, a snuff-coloured coat on his back, and, when he
was not speaking, a pipe in his mouth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who would
live in such a country as England?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no country like America,&rdquo; said his
nearest neighbour, a man also in a white hat, and of a very
ill-favoured countenance&mdash;&ldquo;there is no country like
America,&rdquo; said he, withdrawing a pipe from his mouth;
&ldquo;I think I shall&rdquo;&mdash;and here he took a draught
from a jug, the contents of which he appeared to have in common
with the other&mdash;&ldquo;go to America one of these days
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old England is not such a bad country, after
all,&rdquo; said a third, a simple-looking man in a labouring
dress, who sat smoking a pipe without anything before him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If there was but a little <!-- page 305--><a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>more work
to be got, I should have nothing to say against her; I hope,
however&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hope! who cares what you hope?&rdquo; interrupted
the first, in a savage tone; &ldquo;you are one of those sneaking
hounds who are satisfied with dogs&rsquo; wages&mdash;a bit of
bread and a kick.&nbsp; Work, indeed! who, with the spirit of a
man, would work for a country where there is neither liberty of
speech, nor of action? a land full of beggarly aristocracy,
hungry borough-mongers, insolent parsons, and &lsquo;their . . .
wives and daughters,&rsquo; as William Cobbett says, in his
&lsquo;Register.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the Church of England has been a source of
incalculable mischief to these realms,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>The person who uttered these words sat rather aloof from the
rest; he was dressed in a long black surtout.&nbsp; I could not
see much of his face, partly owing to his keeping it very much
directed to the ground, and partly owing to a large slouched hat
which he wore; I observed, however, that his hair was of a
reddish tinge.&nbsp; On the table near him was a glass and
spoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said the first, alluding to
what this last had said, &ldquo;the Church of England has done
incalculable mischief here.&nbsp; I value no religion three
halfpence, for I believe in none; but the one that I hate most is
the Church of England; so when I get to New York, after I have
shown the fine fellows on the quay a spice of me, by --- the
King, I&rsquo;ll toss up my hat again, and --- the Church of
England too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose the people of New York should clap you in
the stocks?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>These words drew upon me the attention of the <!-- page
306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>whole four.&nbsp; The Radical and his companion stared
at me ferociously; the man in black gave me a peculiar glance
from under his slouched hat; the simple-looking man in the
labouring dress laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at, you fool?&rdquo; said the
Radical, turning and looking at the other, who appeared to be
afraid of him; &ldquo;hold your noise; and a pretty fellow,
you,&rdquo; said he, looking at me, &ldquo;to come here, and
speak against the great American nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak against the great American nation!&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;I rather paid them a compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By supposing they would put me in the stocks!&nbsp;
Well, I call it abusing them, to suppose they would do any such
thing&mdash;stocks, indeed!&mdash;there are no stocks in all the
land.&nbsp; Put me in the stocks! why, the President will come
down to the quay, and ask me to dinner, as soon as he hears what
I have said about the King and Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you
go to America you will say of the President and country, what now
you say of the King and Church, and cry out for somebody to send
you back to England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Radical dashed his pipe to pieces against the table.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I tell you what, young fellow, you are a spy of the
aristocracy, sent here to kick up a disturbance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kicking up a disturbance,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is
rather inconsistent with the office of spy.&nbsp; If I were a
spy, I should hold my head down, and say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black partially raised his head, and gave me
another peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t sent to spy, you are
sent to <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>bully, to prevent people speaking,
and to run down the great American nation; but you shan&rsquo;t
bully me.&nbsp; I say, down with the aristocracy, the beggarly
British aristocracy.&nbsp; Come, what have you to say to
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; repeated the Radical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;down with them as soon as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can!&nbsp; I wish I could.&nbsp; But I can
down with a bully of theirs.&nbsp; Come, will you fight for
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;though, from what I have seen
of them, I should say they are tolerably able to fight for
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t fight for them,&rdquo; said the
Radical, triumphantly; &ldquo;I thought so; all bullies,
especially those of the aristocracy, are cowards.&nbsp; Here,
landlord,&rdquo; said he, raising his voice, and striking against
the table with the jug, &ldquo;some more ale&mdash;he won&rsquo;t
fight for his friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A white feather,&rdquo; said his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landlord, landlord!&rdquo; shouted the Radical,
striking the table with the jug louder than before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who called?&rdquo; said the landlord, coming in at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fill this jug again,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;and be quick about it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Does any one
else want anything?&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;you may bring me
another glass of gin and water.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cold?&rdquo;
said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;with a lump of sugar in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>&ldquo;Gin and water cold, with a lump of sugar in
it,&rdquo; said I, and struck the table with my fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take some?&rdquo; said the landlord, inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;only something came into my
head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said the Radical.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only shamming; he knows his master is here, and
therefore has recourse to these man&oelig;uvres, but it
won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Come, landlord, what are you staring
at?&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you obey your orders?&nbsp; Keeping
your customers waiting in this manner is not the way to increase
your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord looked at the Radical, and then at me.&nbsp; At
last, taking the jug and glass he left the apartment, and
presently returned with each filled with its respective
liquor.&nbsp; He placed the jug with beer before the Radical, and
the glass with gin and water before the man in black, and then,
with a wink to me, he sauntered out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your health, sir,&rdquo; said the man of the
snuff-coloured coat, addressing himself to the one in black;
&ldquo;I honour you for what you said about the Church of
England.&nbsp; Every one who speaks against the Church of England
has my warm heart.&nbsp; Down with it, I say, and may the stones
of it be used for mending the roads, as my friend William says in
his &lsquo;Register.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black, with a courteous nod of his head, drank to
the man in the snuff-coloured coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;With respect to
the steeples,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am not altogether of your
opinion; they might be turned to better account than to serve to
mend the roads; they might still be used as places of <!-- page
309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>worship, but not for the worship of the Church of
England.&nbsp; I have no fault to find with the steeples, it is
the Church itself which I am compelled to arraign; but it will
not stand long, the respectable part of its ministers are already
leaving it.&nbsp; It is a bad Church, a persecuting
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom does it persecute?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The man in black glanced at me slightly, and then replied
slowly, &ldquo;The Catholics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do those whom you call Catholics never
persecute?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever read &lsquo;Fox&rsquo;s Book of
Martyrs&rsquo;?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black, &ldquo;there
is not a word of truth in &lsquo;Fox&rsquo;s Book of
Martyrs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten times more than in the &lsquo;Flos
Sanctorum,&rsquo;&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The man in black looked at me, but made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what say you to the Massacre of the Albigenses and
the Vaudois, &lsquo;whose bones lie scattered on the cold
Alp,&rsquo; or the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is because the Church
of England is not a persecuting Church, that those whom you call
the respectable part are leaving her; it is because they
can&rsquo;t do with the poor Dissenters what Simon de Montfort
did with the Albigenses, and the cruel Piedmontese with the
Vaudois, that they turn to bloody Rome; the Pope will no doubt
welcome them, for the Pope, <!-- page 310--><a
name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 310</span>do you see,
being very much in want, will welcome&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; said the Radical, interfering,
&ldquo;what are you saying about the Pope?&nbsp; I say, Hurrah
for the Pope; I value no religion three halfpence, as I said
before, but if I were to adopt any, it should be the popish as
it&rsquo;s called, because I conceives the popish to be the grand
enemy of the Church of England, of the beggarly aristocracy, and
the borough-monger system, so I won&rsquo;t hear the Pope abused
while I am by.&nbsp; Come, don&rsquo;t look fierce.&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t fight, you know, I have proved it; but I will give
you another chance&mdash;I will fight for the Pope, will you
fight against him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear me, yes,&rdquo; said I, getting up and stepping
forward.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a quiet peaceable young man, and,
being so, am always ready to fight against the Pope&mdash;the
enemy of all peace and quiet; to refuse fighting for the
aristocracy is a widely different thing from refusing to fight
against the Pope; so come on, if you are disposed to fight for
him.&nbsp; To the Pope broken bells, to Saint James broken
shells.&nbsp; No popish vile oppression, but the Protestant
succession.&nbsp; Confusion to the Groyne, hurrah for the Boyne,
for the army at Clonmel, and the Protestant young gentlemen who
live there as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Orangeman,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a Platitude,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The man in black gave a slight start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst that family,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no doubt,
something may be done, but amongst the Methodist preachers I
should conceive that the success would not be great.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>The man in black sat quite still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially amongst those who have wives,&rdquo; I
added.</p>
<p>The man in black stretched his hand towards his gin and
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we shall see what the
grand movement will bring about, and the results of the lessons
in elocution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black lifted the glass up to his mouth, and, in
doing so, let the spoon fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has this to do with the main question?&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;I am waiting here to fight against the
Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Hunter,&rdquo; said the companion of the man in
the snuff-coloured coat, &ldquo;get up, and fight for the
Pope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for the young fellow,&rdquo; said
the man in the snuff-coloured coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;so get up, and serve him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could serve out three like him,&rdquo; said the man
in the snuff-coloured coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better for you,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;the present work will be all the easier for you; get up,
and serve him out at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in the snuff-coloured coat did not stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shows the white feather now?&rdquo; said the
simple-looking man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you to interfere?&rdquo; said the Radical,
turning ferociously towards the simple-looking man; &ldquo;say
another word, and I&rsquo;ll . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you!&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to the man in black,
&ldquo;a pretty fellow you to turn against me, <!-- page 312--><a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>after I had
taken your part!&nbsp; I tell you what, you may fight for
yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see you and your Pope in the pit of
Eldon, before I fight for either of you, so make the most of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t fight?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the Pope,&rdquo; said the Radical;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see the Pope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not fight for the Pope,
whose religion you would turn to, if you were inclined for
any!&nbsp; I see how it is, you are not fond of fighting; but
I&rsquo;ll give you another chance&mdash;you were abusing the
Church of England just now: I&rsquo;ll fight for it&mdash;will
you fight against it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Hunter,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;get up, and
fight against the Church of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no particular quarrel against the Church of
England,&rdquo; said the man in the snuff-coloured coat,
&ldquo;my quarrel is with the aristocracy.&nbsp; If I said
anything against the Church, it was merely for a bit of
corollary, as Master William Cobbett would say; the quarrel with
the Church belongs to this fellow in black; so let him carry it
on.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; he continued suddenly, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t slink from the matter either; it shall never be said
by the fine fellows on the quay of New York, that I
wouldn&rsquo;t fight against the Church of England.&nbsp; So down
with the beggarly aristocracy, the Church, and the Pope, to the
bottom of the pit of Eldon, and may the Pope fall first, and the
others upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, dashing his hat on the table, he placed himself in
an attitude of offence, and rushed forward.&nbsp; He was, as I
have said before, a powerful fellow, and might have proved a
dangerous <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>antagonist, more especially to
myself, who, after my recent encounter with the Flaming Tinman,
and my wrestlings with the evil one, was in anything but fighting
order.&nbsp; Any collision, however, was prevented by the
landlord, who, suddenly appearing, thrust himself between
us.&nbsp; &ldquo;There shall be no fighting here,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;no one shall fight in this house, except it be with
myself; so if you two have anything to say to each other, you had
better go into the field behind the house.&nbsp; But, you
fool,&rdquo; said he, pushing Hunter violently on the breast,
&ldquo;do you know whom you are going to tackle with?&mdash;this
is the young chap that beat Blazing Bosville, only as late as
yesterday, in Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle.&nbsp; Grey Moll told me all
about it last night, when she came for some brandy for her
husband, who, she said, had been half killed; and she described
the young man to me so closely, that I knew him at once, that is,
as soon as I saw how his left hand was bruised, for she told me
he was a left-hand hitter.&nbsp; Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it all true,
young man?&nbsp; Ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you he that beat Flaming
Bosville in Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
beat Flaming Bosville,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he beat
himself.&nbsp; Had he not struck his hand against a tree, I
shouldn&rsquo;t be here at the present moment.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;now
that&rsquo;s just as it should be; I like a modest man, for, as
the parson says, nothing sits better upon a young man than
modesty.&nbsp; I remember, when I was young, fighting with Tom of
Hopton, the best man that ever pulled off coat in England.&nbsp;
I remember, too, that I won the battle; for I happened to hit Tom
of Hopton in the mark, as he was coming in, so that he lost his
wind, and falling squelch on the ground, do ye see, <!-- page
314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>he
lost the battle, though I am free to confess that he was a better
man than myself; indeed, the best man that ever fought in
England; yet still I won the battle, as every customer of mine,
and everybody within twelve miles round, has heard over and over
again.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Hunter, I have one thing to say, if you
choose to go into the field behind the house, and fight the young
man, you can.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll back him for ten pounds; but no
fighting in my kitchen&mdash;because why?&nbsp; I keeps a decent
kind of an establishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to fight the young man,&rdquo; said
Hunter; &ldquo;more especially as he has nothing to say for the
aristocracy.&nbsp; If he chose to fight for them,
indeed&mdash;but he won&rsquo;t, I know: for I see he&rsquo;s a
decent, respectable young man; and, after all, fighting is a
blackguard way of settling a dispute; so I have no wish to fight;
however, there is one thing I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said he,
uplifting his fist, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight this fellow in black
here for half-a-crown, or for nothing, if he pleases; it was he
that got up the last dispute between me and the young man, with
his Pope and his nonsense; so I will fight him for anything he
pleases, and perhaps the young man will be my second; whilst
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Doctor,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;or
whatsoever you be, will you go into the field with Hunter?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll second you, only you must back yourself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll lay five pounds on Hunter, if you are inclined to back
yourself; and will help you to win it as far, do you see, as a
second can; because why?&nbsp; I always likes to do the fair
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I have no wish to fight,&rdquo; said the man <!--
page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>in black, hastily; &ldquo;fighting is not my
trade.&nbsp; If I have given any offence, I beg anybody&rsquo;s
pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Landlord,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what have I to
pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;glad
to see you.&nbsp; This is the first time that you have been at my
house, and I never charge new customers, at least customers such
as you, anything for the first draught.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll come
again, I dare say; shall always be glad to see you.&nbsp; I
won&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; said he, as I put sixpence on the
table; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you shall,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but not in
payment for anything I have had myself: it shall serve to pay for
a jug of ale for that gentleman,&rdquo; said I, pointing to the
simple-looking individual; &ldquo;he is smoking a poor
pipe.&nbsp; I do not mean to say that a pipe is a bad thing; but
a pipe without ale, do you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
just the conduct I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; said Hunter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall be
happy to drink with the young man whenever I meet him at New
York, where, do you see, things are better managed than
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have given offence to anybody,&rdquo; said the man
in black, &ldquo;I repeat that I ask pardon,&mdash;more
especially to the young gentleman, who was perfectly right to
stand up for his religion, just as I&mdash;not that I am of any
particular religion, no more than this honest gentleman
here,&rdquo; bowing to Hunter; &ldquo;but I happen to know
something of the Catholics&mdash;several excellent friends of
mine are Catholics&mdash;and of a surety the Catholic religion is
an ancient religion, and a widely-extended religion, though it
certainly is not a universal <!-- page 316--><a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>religion,
but it has of late made considerable progress, even amongst those
nations who have been particularly opposed to it&mdash;amongst
the Prussians and the Dutch, for example, to say nothing of the
English; and then, in the East, amongst the Persians, amongst the
Armenians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Armenians,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;Oh dear me, the
Armenians&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to say about these people,
sir?&rdquo; said the man in black, lifting up his glass to his
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing farther to say,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;than that the roots of Ararat are occasionally found to be
deeper than those of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s half-a-crown broke,&rdquo; said the
landlord, as the man in black let fall the glass, which was
broken to pieces on the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will pay me the
damage, friend, before you leave this kitchen.&nbsp; I like to
see people drink freely in my kitchen, but not too freely, and I
hate breakages; because why?&nbsp; I keeps a decent kind of an
establishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dingle&mdash;Give them Ale&mdash;Not over
Complimentary&mdash;America&mdash;Many
People&mdash;Washington&mdash;Promiscuous Company&mdash;Language
of the Roads&mdash;The Old Women&mdash;Numerals&mdash;The Man in
Black.</p>
<p>The public-house where the scenes which I have attempted to
describe in the preceding chapters took place, was at the
distance of about two miles from the dingle.&nbsp; The sun was
sinking in the west by the time I returned to the latter
spot.&nbsp; I found Belle seated by a fire, over which her kettle
was suspended.&nbsp; During my absence she had prepared herself a
kind of tent, consisting of large hoops covered over with
tarpaulin, quite impenetrable to rain, however violent.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am glad you are returned,&rdquo; said she, as soon as
she perceived me; &ldquo;I began to be anxious about you.&nbsp;
Did you take my advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I went to the public-house
and drank ale, as you advised me; it cheered, strengthened, and
drove away the horror from my mind&mdash;I am much beholden to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would do you good,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;I remembered that when the poor women in the great house
were afflicted with hysterics, and fearful imaginings, the
surgeon, who was a good, <!-- page 318--><a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>kind man,
used to say, &lsquo;Ale, give them ale, and let it be
strong.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was no advocate for tea, then?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had no objection to tea; but he used to say,
&lsquo;Everything in its season.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shall we take ours
now?&mdash;I have waited for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no objection,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I feel
rather heated, and at present should prefer tea to
ale&mdash;&lsquo;Everything in its season,&rsquo; as the surgeon
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Belle prepared tea, and, as we were taking it, she
said, &ldquo;What did you see and hear at the
public-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you appear to have your
full portion of curiosity; what matters it to you what I saw and
heard at the public-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters very little to me,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;I merely inquired of you, for the sake of a little
conversation&mdash;you were silent, and it is uncomfortable for
two people to sit together without opening their lips&mdash;at
least I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One only feels uncomfortable,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in
being silent, when one happens to be thinking of the individual
with whom one is in company.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I was
not thinking of my companion, but of certain company with whom I
had been at the public-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, young man,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;you are
not over complimentary; but who may this wonderful company have
been&mdash;some young . . .?&rdquo; and here Belle stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there was no young
person&mdash;if person you were going to say.&nbsp; There was a
big portly landlord, whom I dare say you have seen; a noisy
savage Radical, who wanted at first to fasten upon me a quarrel
about America, <!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>but who subsequently drew in his
horns; then there was a strange fellow, a prowling priest, I
believe, whom I have frequently heard of, who at first seemed
disposed to side with the Radical against me, and afterwards with
me against the Radical.&nbsp; There, you know my company, and
what took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there no one else?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mighty curious,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
none else, except a poor simple mechanic, and some common
company, who soon went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle looked at me for a moment, and then appeared to be lost
in thought&mdash;&ldquo;America!&rdquo; said she,
musingly&mdash;&ldquo;America!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of America?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that it is a mighty country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have heard my
father say that the Americans are first-rate marksmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard nothing about that,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;what I heard was, that it is a great and goodly land,
where people can walk about without jostling, and where the
industrious can always find bread; I have frequently thought of
going thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the Radical in the
public-house will perhaps be glad of your company thither; he is
as great an admirer of America as yourself, though I believe on
different grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go by myself,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;unless&mdash;unless that should happen which is not
likely&mdash;I am not fond of Radicals no more than I am of
scoffers and mockers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that I am a scoffer and
mocker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to say you are,&rdquo; said Belle;
<!-- page 320--><a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>&ldquo;but some of your words sound strangely like
scoffing and mocking.&nbsp; I have now one thing to beg, which
is, that if you have anything to say against America, you would
speak it out boldly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I have to say against America?&nbsp; I
never was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people speak against America who never were
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people speak in praise of America who never were
there; but with respect to myself, I have not spoken for or
against America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you liked America you would speak in its
praise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the same rule, if I disliked America I should speak
against it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak with you,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;but I see you dislike the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The country!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the people&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you dislike them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I have heard my father say that the American
marksmen, led on by a chap of the name of Washington, sent the
English to the right-about in double-quick time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is your reason for disliking the
Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that is my reason for
disliking them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take another cup of tea?&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>I took another cup; we were again silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
rather uncomfortable,&rdquo; said I, at last, &ldquo;for people
to sit together without having anything to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 321--><a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>&ldquo;Were you thinking of your company?&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What company?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The present company! oh, ah&mdash;I remember that I
said one only feels uncomfortable in being silent with a
companion, when one happens to be thinking of the
companion.&nbsp; Well, I had been thinking of you the last two or
three minutes, and had just come to the conclusion, that to
prevent us both feeling occasionally uncomfortably towards each
other, having nothing to say, it would be as well to have a
standing subject, on which to employ our tongues.&nbsp; Belle, I
have determined to give you lessons in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Armenian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of Ararat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was the place where the ark rested; I have
heard the chaplain in the great house talk of it; besides, I have
read of it in the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Armenian is the speech of people of that place,
and I should like to teach it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To prevent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, to prevent our occasionally feeling
uncomfortable together.&nbsp; Your acquiring it besides might
prove of ulterior advantage to us both; for example, suppose you
and I were in promiscuous company,&mdash;at Court, for
example,&mdash;and you had something to communicate to me which
you did not wish any one else to be acquainted with, how safely
you might communicate it to me in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would not the language of the roads do as well?&rdquo;
said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some places it would,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but not
<!-- page 322--><a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>at Court, owing to its resemblance to thieves&rsquo;
slang.&nbsp; There is Hebrew, again, which I was thinking of
teaching you, till the idea of being presented at Court made me
abandon it, from the probability of our being understood, in the
event of our speaking it, by at least half a dozen people in our
vicinity.&nbsp; There is Latin, it is true, or Greek, which we
might speak aloud at Court with perfect confidence of safety, but
upon the whole I should prefer teaching you Armenian, not because
it would be a safer language to hold communication with at Court,
but because, not being very well grounded in it myself, I am
apprehensive that its words and forms may escape from my
recollection, unless I have sometimes occasion to call them
forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we shall have to part company before I have
learnt it,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;in the meantime, if I wish
to say anything to you in private, somebody being by, shall I
speak in the language of the roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If no roadster is nigh you may,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and I will do my best to understand you.&nbsp; Belle, I
will now give you a lesson in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean no harm,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least; I merely propose the thing to prevent
our occasionally feeling uncomfortable together.&nbsp; Let us
begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop till I have removed the tea-things,&rdquo; said
Belle; and, getting up, she removed them to her own
encampment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said Belle, returning, and taking
her former seat, &ldquo;to join with you in anything which will
serve to pass away the time agreeably, provided there is no harm
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have determined
to commence the course of Armenian lessons by teaching you the
numerals; but, before I do that, it will be as well to tell you
that the Armenian language is called Haik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that word will hang upon my memory,&rdquo;
said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why hang upon it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the old women in the great house used to call
so the chimney-hook, on which they hung the kettle; in like
manner, on the hake of my memory I will hang your
hake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will make an apt
scholar; but mind that I did not say hake, but haik; the words
are, however, very much alike; and, as you observe, upon your
hake you may hang my haik.&nbsp; We will now proceed to the
numerals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are numerals?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Numbers.&nbsp; I will say the Haikan numbers up to
ten.&nbsp; There&mdash;have you heard them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, try and repeat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only remember number one,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;and that because it is me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will repeat them again,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and pay
greater attention.&nbsp; Now, try again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, jergo, earache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither said jergo, nor earache.&nbsp; I said yergou
and yerek.&nbsp; Belle, I am afraid I shall have some difficulty
with you as a scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle made no answer.&nbsp; Her eyes were turned in the
direction of the winding path which led from the bottom of the
hollow, where we were <!-- page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span

&ldquo;Gorgio shunella,&rdquo; <a name="citation324a"></a><a
href="#footnote324a" class="citation">[324a]</a> she said, at
length, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pure Rommany,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where?&rdquo; I
added, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dovey odoi,&rdquo; <a name="citation324b"></a><a
href="#footnote324b" class="citation">[324b]</a> said Belle,
nodding with her head towards the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will soon see who it is,&rdquo; said I; and starting
up, I rushed towards the pathway, intending to lay violent hands
on any one I might find lurking in its windings.&nbsp; Before,
however, I had reached its commencement, a man, somewhat above
the middle height, advanced from it into the dingle, in whom I
recognised the man in black whom I had seen in the
public-house.</p>
<h2><!-- page 325--><a name="page325"></a><span

<p>Buona Sera&mdash;Rather Apprehensive&mdash;The Steep
Bank&mdash;Lovely Virgin&mdash;Hospitality&mdash;Tory
Minister&mdash;Custom of the Country&mdash;Sneering
Smile&mdash;Wandering Zigan&mdash;Gypsies&rsquo;
Cloaks&mdash;Certain Faculty&mdash;Acute Answer&mdash;Various
Ways&mdash;Addio&mdash;Best Hollands.</p>
<p>The man in black and myself stood opposite to each other for a
minute or two in silence; I will not say that we confronted each
other that time, for the man in black, after a furtive glance,
did not look me in the face, but kept his eyes fixed, apparently
on the leaves of a bunch of ground nuts which were growing at my
feet.&nbsp; At length, looking around the dingle, he exclaimed,
&ldquo;Buona sera, I hope I don&rsquo;t intrude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have as much right here,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as I
or my companion; but you had no right to stand listening to our
conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not listening,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I was
hesitating whether to advance or retire; and if I heard some of
your conversation, the fault was not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see why you should have hesitated if your
intentions were good,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the kind of place in which I found myself might
excuse some hesitation,&rdquo; said the <!-- page 326--><a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>man in
black, looking around; &ldquo;moreover, from what I had seen of
your demeanour at the public-house, I was rather apprehensive
that the reception I might experience at your hands might be more
rough than agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may have been your motive for coming to this
place?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Per far visita a sua signoria, ecco il
motivo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you speak to me in that gibberish?&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;do you think I understand it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not Armenian,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;but it might serve, in a place like this, for the
breathing of a little secret communication, were any common
roadster near at hand.&nbsp; It would not do at Court, it is
true, being the language of singing women, and the like; but we
are not at Court&mdash;when we are, I can perhaps summon up a
little indifferent Latin, if I have anything private to
communicate to the learned Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at the conclusion of this speech the man in black lifted
up his head, and, for some moments, looked me in the face.&nbsp;
The muscles of his own seemed to be slightly convulsed, and his
mouth opened in a singular manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that for some time you
were standing near me and my companion, in the mean act of
listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;I
heard from the steep bank above, that to which I have now
alluded, whilst I was puzzling myself to find the path which
leads to your retreat.&nbsp; I made, indeed, nearly the compass
of the whole thicket before I found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you know that I was here?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p><!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
327</span>&ldquo;The landlord of the public-house, with whom I
had some conversation concerning you, informed me that he had no
doubt I should find you in this place, to which he gave me
instructions not very clear.&nbsp; But, now I am here, I crave
permission to remain a little time, in order that I may hold some
communion with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;since you are come, you are
welcome; please to step this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I conducted the man in black to the fireplace, where
Belle was standing, who had risen from her stool on my springing
up to go in quest of the stranger.&nbsp; The man in black looked
at her with evident curiosity, then making her rather a graceful
bow, &ldquo;Lovely virgin,&rdquo; said he, stretching out his
hand, &ldquo;allow me to salute your fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not in the habit of shaking hands with
strangers,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not presume to request to shake hands with
you,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;I merely wished to be
permitted to salute with my lips the extremity of your two
forefingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never permit anything of the kind,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;I do not approve of such unmanly ways, they are only
befitting those who lurk in corners or behind trees, listening to
the conversation of people who would fain be private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for a listener then?&rdquo; said the man
in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, indeed I do,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;the young
man may receive your excuses, and put confidence in them if he
please, but for my part I neither admit them, nor believe
them;&rdquo; and thereupon flinging her long hair back, which was
hanging over her cheeks, she seated herself on her stool.</p>
<p><!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>&ldquo;Come, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have bidden
the gentleman welcome; I beseech you, therefore, to make him
welcome; he is a stranger, where we are at home, therefore, even
did we wish him away, we are bound to treat him
kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not English doctrine,&rdquo; said the man
in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the English prided themselves on their
hospitality,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do so,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;they
are proud of showing hospitality to people above them, that is,
to those who do not want it, but of the hospitality which you
were now describing, and which is Arabian, they know
nothing.&nbsp; No Englishman will tolerate another in his house,
from whom he does not expect advantage of some kind, and to those
from whom he does, he can be civil enough.&nbsp; An Englishman
thinks that, because he is in his own house, he has a right to be
boorish and brutal to any one who is disagreeable to him, as all
those are who are really in want of assistance.&nbsp; Should a
hunted fugitive rush into an Englishman&rsquo;s house, beseeching
protection, and appealing to the master&rsquo;s feelings of
hospitality, the Englishman would knock him down in the
passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too general,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in your
strictures.&nbsp; Lord ---, the unpopular Tory minister, was once
chased through the streets of London by a mob, and, being in
danger of his life, took shelter in the shop of a Whig
linendraper, declaring his own unpopular name, and appealing to
the linendraper&rsquo;s feelings of hospitality; whereupon the
linendraper, utterly forgetful of all party rancour, nobly
responded to the appeal, and telling his wife to conduct his
lordship upstairs, jumped over the <!-- page 329--><a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>counter,
with his ell in his hand, and placing himself with half a dozen
of his assistants at the door of his boutique, manfully
confronted the mob, telling them that he would allow himself to
be torn to a thousand pieces, ere he would permit them to injure
a hair of his lordship&rsquo;s head: what do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; tittered the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am afraid your own
practice is not very different from that which you have been just
now describing; you sided with the Radical in the public-house
against me as long as you thought him the most powerful, and then
turned against him when you saw he was cowed.&nbsp; What have you
to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! when one is in Rome, I mean England, one must do as
they do in England; I was merely conforming to the custom of the
country, he! he! but I beg your pardon here, as I did in the
public-house.&nbsp; I made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we will drop the matter,
but pray seat yourself on that stone, and I will sit down on the
grass near you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black, after proffering two or three excuses for
occupying what he supposed to be my seat, sat down upon the
stone, and I squatted down, Gypsy fashion, just opposite to him,
Belle sitting on her stool at a slight distance on my
right.&nbsp; After a time I addressed him thus: &ldquo;Am I to
reckon this a mere visit of ceremony? should it prove so, it will
be, I believe, the first visit of the kind ever paid
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you permit me to ask,&rdquo; said the man in black
. . . &ldquo;the weather is very warm,&rdquo; said he,
interrupting himself, and taking off his hat.</p>
<p><!-- page 330--><a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
330</span>I now observed that he was partly bald, his red hair
having died away from the fore part of his crown&mdash;his
forehead was high, his eyebrows scanty, his eyes grey and sly,
with a downward tendency, his nose was slightly aquiline, his
mouth rather large&mdash;a kind of sneering smile played
continually on his lips, his complexion was somewhat
rubicund.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bad countenance,&rdquo; said Belle, in the language
of the roads, observing that my eyes were fixed on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does not my countenance please you, fair damsel?&rdquo;
said the man in black, resuming his hat, and speaking in a
peculiarly gentle voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you understand the
language of the roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As little as I do Armenian,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;but I understand look and tone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, perhaps,&rdquo; retorted Belle; &ldquo;and, to
tell you the truth, I like your tone as little as your
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have you forgot what I
was saying just now about the duties of hospitality?&nbsp; You
have not yet answered my question,&rdquo; said I, addressing
myself to the man, &ldquo;with respect to your visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you permit me to ask who you are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the place where I live?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the man in black, looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the name of this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told it was Mumpers&rsquo; <a
name="citation330"></a><a href="#footnote330"
class="citation">[330]</a> or Gypsies&rsquo; Dingle,&rdquo; said
the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and this forge and tent,
what do they look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the forge and tent of a wandering Zigan; I have
seen the like in Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
331</span>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they belong to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you, then, a Gypsy?&rdquo; said the man in
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else should I be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you seem to have been acquainted with various
individuals with whom I have likewise had acquaintance; and you
have even alluded to matters, and even words, which have passed
between me and them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how Gypsies live?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By hammering old iron, I believe, and telling
fortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s my forge, and
yonder is some iron, though not old, and by your own confession I
am a soothsayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you come by your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if you want me to reveal the
secrets of my trade, I have, of course, nothing farther to
say.&nbsp; Go to the scarlet dyer, and ask him how he dyes
cloth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why scarlet?&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it because Gypsies blush like scarlet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies never blush,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
Gypsies&rsquo; cloaks are scarlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should almost take you for a Gypsy,&rdquo; said the
man in black, &ldquo;but for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for that same lesson in Armenian, and your general
knowledge of languages; as for your manners and appearance I will
say nothing,&rdquo; said the man in black, with a titter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should not a Gypsy possess a knowledge of
languages?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the Gypsy race is perfectly illiterate,&rdquo;
said the man in black; &ldquo;they are possessed, it is <!-- page
332--><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>true, of a knavish acuteness, and are particularly
noted for giving subtle and evasive answers&mdash;and in your
answers, I confess, you remind me of them; but that one of the
race should acquire a learned language like the Armenian, and
have a general knowledge of literature, is a thing <i>che io non
credo afatto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you take me for?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;I should
consider you to be a philologist, who, for some purpose, has
taken up a Gypsy life; but I confess to you that your way of
answering questions is far too acute for a
philologist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should not a philologist be able to answer
questions acutely?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the philological race is the most stupid under
heaven,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;they are possessed,
it is true, of a certain faculty for picking up words, and a
memory for retaining them; but that any one of the sect should be
able to give a rational answer, to say nothing of an acute one,
on any subject&mdash;even though the subject were
philology&mdash;is a thing of which I have no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you found me giving a lesson in Armenian to this
handmaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I did,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you heard me give what you are disposed to call
acute answers to the questions you asked me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I did,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would any one but a philologist think of giving a
lesson in Armenian to a handmaid in a dingle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, don&rsquo;t you see that it is possible for
<!-- page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
333</span>a philologist to give not only a rational, but an acute
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the man in
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely puzzled,&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puzzled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really puzzled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remain so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man in black, rising,
&ldquo;puzzled or not, I will no longer trespass upon your and
this young lady&rsquo;s retirement; only allow me, before I go,
to apologise for my intrusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apology is necessary,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;will you
please to take anything before you go?&nbsp; I think this young
lady, at my request, would contrive to make you a cup of
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;he! he!&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t drink tea; I don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;if, indeed,
you had . . . &rdquo; and here he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like gin and water, is
there?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I am sorry to say I have
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gin and water,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;how
do you know that I am fond of gin and water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not see you drinking some at the
public-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and I
remember that, when I called for some, you repeated my
words.&nbsp; Permit me to ask, is gin and water an unusual drink
in England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not usually drunk cold, and with a lump of
sugar,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you know who I was by my calling for it
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>&ldquo;Gypsies have various ways of obtaining
information,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all your knowledge,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;you do not appear to have known that I was coming to visit
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gypsies do not pretend to know anything which relates
to themselves,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I advise you, if you
ever come again, to come openly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I your permission to come again?&rdquo; said the
man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come when you please; this dingle is as free for you as
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will visit you again,&rdquo; said the man in
black&mdash;&ldquo;till then, addio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belle,&rdquo; said I, after the man in black had
departed, &ldquo;we did not treat that man very hospitably; he
left us without having eaten or drunk at our expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You offered him some tea,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;which, as it is mine, I should have grudged him, for I
like him not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our liking or disliking him had nothing to do with the
matter; he was our visitor and ought not to have been permitted
to depart dry; living as we do in this desert, we ought always to
be prepared to administer to the wants of our visitors.&nbsp;
Belle, do you know where to procure any good Hollands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have no buts.&nbsp; Belle, I expect that with as
little delay as possible you procure, at my expense, the best
Hollands you can find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Excursions&mdash;Adventurous English&mdash;Opaque
Forests&mdash;The Greatest Patience.</p>
<p>Time passed on, and Belle and I lived in the dingle; when I
say lived, the reader must not imagine that we were always
there.&nbsp; She went out upon her pursuits, and I went out where
inclination led me; but my excursions were very short ones, and
hers occasionally occupied whole days and nights.&nbsp; If I am
asked how we passed the time when we were together in the dingle,
I would answer that we passed the time very tolerably, all things
considered; we conversed together, and when tired of conversing I
would sometimes give Belle a lesson in Armenian; her progress was
not particularly brilliant, but upon the whole satisfactory; in
about a fortnight she had hung up one hundred Haikan numerals
upon the hake of her memory.&nbsp; I found her conversation
highly entertaining; she had seen much of England and Wales, and
had been acquainted with some of the most remarkable characters
who travelled the roads at that period; and let me be permitted
to say that many remarkable characters have travelled the roads
of England, of whom fame has never said a word.&nbsp; I loved to
hear her anecdotes of these people; some of whom I <!-- page
336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>found had occasionally attempted to lay violent hands
either upon her person or effects, and had invariably been
humbled by her without the assistance of either justice or
constable.&nbsp; I could clearly see, however, that she was
rather tired of England, and wished for a change of scene; she
was particularly fond of talking of America, to which country her
aspirations chiefly tended.&nbsp; She had heard much of America,
which had excited her imagination; for at that time America was
much talked of, on roads and in homesteads&mdash;at least, so
said Belle, who had good opportunities of knowing&mdash;and most
people allowed that it was a good country for adventurous
English.&nbsp; The people who chiefly spoke against it, as she
informed me, were soldiers disbanded upon pensions, the sextons
of village churches, and excisemen.&nbsp; Belle had a craving
desire to visit that country, and to wander with cart and little
animal amongst its forests: when I would occasionally object,
that she would be exposed to danger from strange and perverse
customers, she said that she had not wandered the roads of
England so long and alone, to be afraid of anything which might
befall in America; and that she hoped, with God&rsquo;s favour,
to be able to take her own part, and to give to perverse
customers as good as they might bring.&nbsp; She had a dauntless
heart, that same Belle.&nbsp; Such was the staple of
Belle&rsquo;s conversation.&nbsp; As for mine, I would endeavour
to entertain her with strange dreams of adventure, in which I
figured in opaque forests, strangling wild beasts, or discovering
and plundering the hordes of dragons; and sometimes I would
narrate to her other things far more genuine&mdash;how I had
tamed savage mares, wrestled with <!-- page 337--><a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>Satan, and
had dealings with ferocious publishers.&nbsp; Belle had a kind
heart, and would weep at the accounts I gave her of my early
wrestlings with the dark Monarch.&nbsp; She would sigh, too, as I
recounted the many slights and degradations I had received at the
hands of ferocious publishers; but she had the curiosity of a
woman; and once, when I talked to her of the triumphs which I had
achieved over unbroken mares, she lifted up her head and
questioned me as to the secret of the virtue which I possessed
over the aforesaid animals; whereupon I sternly reprimanded, and
forthwith commanded her to repeat the Armenian numerals; and, on
her demurring, I made use of words, to escape which she was glad
to comply, saying the Armenian numerals from one to a hundred,
which numerals, as a punishment for her curiosity, I made her
repeat three times, loading her with the bitterest reproaches
whenever she committed the slightest error, either in accent or
pronunciation, which reproaches she appeared to bear with the
greatest patience.&nbsp; And now I have given a very fair account
of the manner in which Isopel Berners and myself passed our time
in the dingle.</p>

<p>Amongst other excursions, I went several times to the
public-house to which I introduced the reader in a former
chapter.&nbsp; I had experienced such beneficial effects from the
ale I had drunk on that occasion, that I wished to put its virtue
to a frequent test; nor did the ale on subsequent trials belie
the good opinion which I had at first formed of it.&nbsp; After
each visit which I made to the public-house, I found my frame
stronger and my mind more cheerful than they had previously
been.&nbsp; The landlord appeared at all times glad to see me,
and insisted that I should sit within the bar, where, leaving his
other guests to be attended to by a niece of his, who officiated
as his housekeeper, he would sit beside me and talk of matters
concerning &ldquo;the ring,&rdquo; indulging himself with a cigar
and a glass of sherry, which he told me was his favourite wine,
whilst I drank my ale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I loves the conversation of
all you coves of the ring,&rdquo; said he once, &ldquo;which is

will be served, every dog has his day, and mine has been a fine
one&mdash;let me be content.&nbsp; After beating Tom of Hopton,
there was not much more to be done in the way of reputation; I
have long sat in my bar the wonder and glory of this here
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m content, as far as reputation
goes; I only wish money would come in a little faster; however,
the next main of cocks will bring me in something
handsome&mdash;comes off next Wednesday, at ---, have ventured
ten five-pound notes&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t say ventured
either&mdash;run no risk at all, because why?&nbsp; I knows my
birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; About ten days after this harangue I called
again, at about three o&rsquo;clock one afternoon.&nbsp; The
landlord was seated on a bench by a table in the common room,
which was entirely empty; he was neither smoking nor drinking,
but sat with his arms folded, and his head hanging down over his
breast.&nbsp; At the sound of my step he looked up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am glad you are come, I was
just thinking about you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;it was very kind of you, especially at a time like
this, when your mind must be full of your good fortune.&nbsp;
Allow me to congratulate you on the sums of money you won by the
main of cocks at ---.&nbsp; I hope you brought it all safe
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Safe home!&rdquo; said the landlord;
&ldquo;I brought myself safe home, and that was all; came home
without a shilling, regularly done, cleaned out.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but after you
had won the money, you ought to have been satisfied, and not
risked it again&mdash;how did you lose it?&nbsp; I hope not by
the pea and <!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 340</span>thimble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pea and
thimble,&rdquo; said the landlord&mdash;&ldquo;not I; those
confounded cocks left me nothing to lose by the pea and
thimble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
thought that you knew your birds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, so I
did,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;I knew the birds to be good
birds, and so they proved, and would have won if better birds had
not been brought against them, of which I knew nothing; and so,
do you see, I am done, regularly done.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be cast down;
there is one thing of which the cocks by their misfortune cannot
deprive you&mdash;your reputation; make the most of that, give up
cock-fighting, and be content with the custom of your house, of
which you will always have plenty, as long as you are the wonder
and glory of the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord struck the table before him violently with his
fist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound my reputation!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No reputation that I have will be satisfaction to my
brewer for the seventy pounds I owe him.&nbsp; Reputation
won&rsquo;t pass for the current coin of this here realm; and let
me tell you, that if it a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t backed by some of it,
it a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a bit better than rotten cabbage, as I have
found.&nbsp; Only three weeks since I was, as I told you, the
wonder and glory of the neighbourhood; and people used to come to
look at me, and worship me; but as soon as it began to be
whispered about that I owed money to the brewer, they presently
left off all that kind of thing; and now, during the last three
days, since the tale of my misfortune with the cocks has got
wind, almost everybody has left off coming to the house, and the
few who does, merely comes to insult and flout me.&nbsp; It was
only last night that fellow, Hunter, called me an old <!-- page
341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>fool in my own kitchen here.&nbsp; He wouldn&rsquo;t
have called me a fool a fortnight ago; &rsquo;twas I called him
fool then, and last night he called me old fool; what do you
think of that?&mdash;the man that beat Tom of Hopton, to be
called, not only a fool, but an old fool; and I hadn&rsquo;t
heart, with one blow of this here fist into his face, to send his
head ringing against the wall; for when a man&rsquo;s pocket is
low, do you see, his heart a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t much higher; but it
is of no use talking, something must be done.&nbsp; I was
thinking of you just as you came in, for you are just the person
that can help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to ask me to lend
you the money which you want, it will be to no purpose, as I have
very little of my own, just enough for my own occasions; it is
true, if you desired it, I would be your intercessor with the
person to whom you owe the money, though I should hardly imagine
that anything I could say&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
right there,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;much the brewer
would care for anything you could say on my behalf&mdash;your
going would be the very way to do me up entirely.&nbsp; A pretty
opinion he would have of the state of my affairs if I were to
send him such a &rsquo;cessor as you; and as for your lending me
money, don&rsquo;t think I was ever fool enough to suppose either
that you had any, or if you had that you would be fool enough to
lend me any.&nbsp; No, no, the coves of the ring knows better; I
have been in the ring myself, and knows what a fighting cove is,
and though I was fool enough to back those birds, I was never
quite fool enough to lend anybody money.&nbsp; What I am about to
propose is something very different from going to my landlord, or
lending any capital; something which, though it <!-- page
342--><a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>will put money into my pocket, will likewise put
something handsome into your own.&nbsp; I want to get up a fight
in this here neighbourhood, which would be sure to bring plenty
of people to my house, for a week before and after it takes
place; and as people can&rsquo;t come without drinking, I think I
could, during one fortnight, get off for the brewer all the sour
and unsaleable liquids he now has, which people wouldn&rsquo;t
drink at any other time, and by that means, do you see, liquidate
my debt; then, by means of betting, making first all right, do
you see, I have no doubt that I could put something handsome into
my pocket and yours, for I should wish you to be the fighting
man, as I think I can depend upon you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
really must excuse me,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have no wish to
figure as a pugilist; besides, there is such a difference in our
ages; you may be the stronger man of the two, and perhaps the
hardest hitter, but I am in much better condition, am more active
on my legs, so that I am almost sure I should have the advantage,
for, as you very properly observed, &lsquo;Youth will be
served.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean to
fight,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;I think I could beat you
if I were to train a little; but in the fight I propose I looks
more to the main chance than anything else.&nbsp; I question
whether half so many people could be brought together if you were
to fight with me as the person I have in view, or whether there
would be half such opportunities for betting, for I am a man, do
you see; the person I wants you to fight with is not a man, but
the young woman you keeps company with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young woman I keep company with,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;pray what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
343</span>&ldquo;We will go into the bar, and have
something,&rdquo; said the landlord, getting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
niece is out, and there is no one in the house, so we can talk
the . matter over quietly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I followed him
into the bar, where, having drawn me a jug of ale, helped himself
as usual to a glass of sherry, and lighted a cigar, he proceeded
to explain himself farther.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I wants, is to get
up a fight between a man and a woman; there never has yet been
such a thing in the ring, and the mere noise of the matter would
bring thousands of people together, quite enough to drink
out&mdash;for the thing should be close to my house&mdash;all the
brewer&rsquo;s stock of liquids, both good and bad.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you were the other day boasting
of the respectability of your house; do you think that a fight
between a man and a woman close to your establishment would add
to its respectability?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound the
respectability of my house!&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;will
the respectability of my house pay the brewer, or keep the roof
over my head?&nbsp; No, no! when respectability won&rsquo;t keep
a man, do you see, the best thing is to let it go and
wander.&nbsp; Only let me have my own way, and both the brewer,
myself, and every one of us, will be satisfied.&nbsp; And then
the betting&mdash;what a deal we may make by the
betting!&mdash;and that we shall have all to ourselves, you, I,
and the young woman; the brewer will have no hand in that.&nbsp;
I can manage to raise ten pounds, and if by flashing that about I
don&rsquo;t manage to make a hundred, call me horse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the party should lose,
on whom you sport your money, even as the birds did?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must first make all right,&rdquo; said the landlord,
&ldquo;as I told you before; the birds were <!-- page 344--><a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>irrational
beings, and therefore couldn&rsquo;t come to an understanding
with the others, as you and the young woman can.&nbsp; The birds
fought fair; but I intend that you and the young woman should
fight cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by
cross?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the
landlord, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t attempt to gammon me; you in the
ring, and pretend not to know what fighting cross is!&nbsp; That
won&rsquo;t do, my fine fellow; but as no one is near us, I will
speak out.&nbsp; I intend that you and the young woman should
understand one another, and agree beforehand which should be
beat; and if you take my advice, you will determine between you
that the young woman shall be beat, as I am sure that the odds
will run high upon her, her character as a fist-woman being
spread far and wide, so that all the flats who think it will be
all right will back her, as I myself would, if I thought it would
be a fair thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;you would not have us fight fair?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;By
no means,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;because why?&mdash;I
conceives that a cross is a certainty to those who are in it,
whereas by the fair thing one may lose all he has.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you said the other day, that
you liked the fair thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That was by way of
gammon,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;just, do you see, as a
Parliament cove might say, speechifying from a barrel to a set of
flats, whom he means to sell.&nbsp; Come, what do you think of
the plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very ingenious one,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The folks in this neighbourhood are beginning to call me
old fool; but if they don&rsquo;t call me something else, when
they sees me friends with the brewer, and money in my pocket, my
name is not Catchpole.&nbsp; Come, <!-- page 345--><a
name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 345</span>drink your
ale, and go home to the young gentlewoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; said I, rising from my seat, after
finishing the remainder of the ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll have any objection?&rdquo;
said the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do what?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to fight cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will do your best to persuade her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I will not,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you fool enough to wish to fight fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am wise enough to wish not
to fight at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s my brewer to be paid?&rdquo; said the
landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change my religion,&rdquo; said the
landlord.</p>

<p>Another Visit&mdash;<i>&Agrave; la Margutte</i>&mdash;Clever
Man&mdash;Napoleon&rsquo;s Estimate&mdash;Another Statue.</p>
<p>One evening Belle and myself received another visit from the
man in black.&nbsp; After a little conversation of not much
importance, I asked him whether he would not take some
refreshment, assuring him that I was now in possession of some
very excellent Hollands, which, with a glass, a jug of water, and
a lump of sugar, were heartily at his service; he accepted my
offer, and Belle going with a jug to the spring, from which she
was in the habit of procuring water for tea, speedily returned
with it full of the clear, delicious water of which I have
already spoken.&nbsp; Having placed the jug by the side of the
man in black, she brought him a glass and spoon, and a tea-cup,
the latter containing various lumps of snowy-white sugar: in the
meantime I had produced a bottle of the stronger liquid.&nbsp;
The man in black helped himself to some water, and likewise to
some Hollands, the proportion of water being about two-thirds;
then adding a lump of sugar, he stirred the whole up, tasted it,
and said that it was good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the good things of life,&rdquo; he
added, after a short pause.</p>
<p><!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>&ldquo;What are the others?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Malvoisia sack,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;and partridge, and beccafico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you say to high mass?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High mass!&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;however,&rdquo; he continued, after a pause, &ldquo;I will
be frank with you; I came to be so; I may have heard high mass on
a time, and said it too; but as for any predilection for it, I
assure you I have no more than for a long High Church
sermon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak <i>&agrave; la Margutte</i>,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Margutte!&rdquo; said the man in black, musingly,
&ldquo;Margutte!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have read Pulci, I suppose?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the man in black, laughing;
&ldquo;I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be rendered into English,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;something in this style:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;To which Margutte answered with a sneer,<br
/>
I like the blue no better than the black,<br />
My faith consists alone in savoury cheer,<br />
In roasted capons, and in potent sack;<br />
But above all, in famous gin and clear,<br />
Which often lays the Briton on his back,<br />
With lump of sugar, and with lymph from well,<br />
I drink it, and defy the fiends of hell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;that
is more than Mezzofante <a name="citation347"></a><a
href="#footnote347" class="citation">[347]</a> could have done
for a stanza of Byron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clever man,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said the man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mezzofante di Bologna.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;now
<!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
348</span>I know that you are not a Gypsy, at least a soothsayer;
no soothsayer would have said that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;does he not understand
five-and-twenty tongues?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;and
five-and-twenty added to them; but, he! he! he! it was
principally from him, who is certainly the greatest of
Philologists, that I formed my opinion of the sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to speak of him with more respect,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;I have heard say that he has done good service to
your See.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;he has
done good service to our See, that is, in his way; when the
neophytes of the propaganda are to be examined in the several
tongues in which they are destined to preach, he is appointed to
question them, the questions being first written down for him, or
else, he! he! he!&mdash;Of course you know Napoleon&rsquo;s
estimate of Mezzofante; he sent for the linguist from motives of
curiosity, and after some discourse with him, told him that he
might depart; then turning to some of his generals, he observed,
&lsquo;<i>Nous avons eu ici un exemple qu&rsquo;un homme peut
avoir beaucoup de paroles avec bien peu
d&rsquo;esprit</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are ungrateful to him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;well,
perhaps, when he is dead and gone you will do him
justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;when he is
dead and gone, we intend to erect him a statue of wood, on the
left-hand side of the door of the Vatican library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of wood?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the son of a carpenter, you know,&rdquo; <!--
page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>said the man in black; &ldquo;the figure will be of
wood, for no other reason, I assure you; he! he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should place another statue on the
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we shall,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;but we know of no one amongst the philologists of Italy,
nor, indeed, of the other countries inhabited by the faithful,
worthy to sit parallel in effigy with our illustrissimo; when,
indeed, we have conquered these regions of the perfidious by
bringing the inhabitants thereof to the true faith, I have no
doubt that we shall be able to select one worthy to bear him
company&mdash;one whose statue shall be placed on the right hand
of the library, in testimony of our joy at his conversion; for,
as you know, &lsquo;There is more joy,&rsquo; etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wood?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;no, if
I be consulted as to the material for the statue, I should
strongly recommend bronze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when the man in black had said this, he emptied his second
tumbler of its contents, and prepared himself another.</p>

Glass&mdash;Money&mdash;Quite Original.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you hope to bring these regions again beneath the
banner of the Roman See?&rdquo; said I; after the man in black
had prepared the beverage, and tasted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;how can we
fail?&nbsp; Is not the Church of these regions going to lose its
prerogative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its prerogative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; those who should be the guardians of the religion
of England are about to grant Papists emancipation, and to remove
the disabilities from Dissenters, which will allow the Holy
Father to play his own game in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my inquiring how the Holy Father intended to play his game,
the man in black gave me to understand that he intended for the
present to cover the land with temples, in which the religion
<!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>of Protestants would be continually scoffed at and
reviled.</p>
<p>On my observing that such behaviour would savour strongly of
ingratitude, the man in black gave me to understand that if I
entertained the idea that the See of Rome was ever influenced in
its actions by any feeling of gratitude I was much mistaken,
assuring me that if the See of Rome in any encounter should
chance to be disarmed and its adversary, from a feeling of
magnanimity, should restore the sword which had been knocked out
of its hand, the See of Rome always endeavoured on the first
opportunity to plunge the said sword into its adversary&rsquo;s
bosom; conduct which the man in black seemed to think was very
wise, and which he assured me had already enabled it to get rid
of a great many troublesome adversaries, and would, he had no
doubt, enable it to get rid of a great many more.</p>
<p>On my attempting to argue against the propriety of such
behaviour, the man in black cut the matter short, by saying, that
if one party was a fool he saw no reason why the other should
imitate it in its folly.</p>
<p>After musing a little while, I told him that emancipation had
not yet passed through the legislature, and that perhaps it never
would; reminding him that there was often many a slip between the
cup and the lip; to which observation the man in black agreed,
assuring me, however, that there was no doubt that emancipation
would be carried, inasmuch as there was a very loud cry at
present in the land&mdash;a cry of &ldquo;tolerance,&rdquo; which
had almost frightened the Government out of its wits; who, to get
rid of the cry, was going <!-- page 352--><a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>to grant
all that was asked in the way of toleration, instead of telling
the people to &ldquo;Hold their nonsense,&rdquo; and cutting them
down, provided they continued bawling longer.</p>
<p>I questioned the man in black with respect to the origin of
this cry; but he said, to trace it to its origin would require a
long history; that, at any rate, such a cry was in existence, the
chief raisers of it being certain of the nobility, called Whigs,
who hoped by means of it to get into power, and to turn out
certain ancient adversaries of theirs called Tories, who were for
letting things remain <i>in statu quo</i>; that these Whigs were
backed by a party amongst the people called Radicals, a specimen
of whom I had seen in the public-house; a set of fellows who were
always in the habit of bawling against those in place; &ldquo;and
so,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;by means of these parties, and the
hubbub which the Papists and other smaller sects are making, a
general emancipation will be carried, and the Church of England
humbled, which is the principal thing which the See of Rome cares
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my telling the man in black that I believed that, even
among the high dignitaries of the English Church, there were many
who wished to grant perfect freedom to religions of all
descriptions, he said he was aware that such was the fact, and
that such a wish was anything but wise, inasmuch as, if they had
any regard for the religion they professed, they ought to stand
by it through thick and thin, proclaiming it to be the only true
one, and denouncing all others, in an alliterative style, as
dangerous and damnable; whereas, by their present conduct, they
were bringing their religion into contempt with the people at
large, who would <!-- page 353--><a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>never continue long attached to a
Church the ministers of which did not stand up for it, and
likewise cause their own brethren, who had a clearer notion of
things, to be ashamed of belonging to it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I speak
advisedly,&rdquo; said he, in continuation, &ldquo;there is one
Platitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I hope there is only one,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you
surely would not adduce the likes and dislikes of that poor silly
fellow as the criterions of the opinions of any party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know him,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;nay,
I heard you mention him in the public-house; the fellow is not
very wise, I admit, but he has sense enough to know, that unless
a Church can make people hold their tongues when it thinks fit,
it is scarcely deserving the name of a Church; no, I think that
the fellow is not such a very bad stick, and that upon the whole
he is, or rather was, an advantageous specimen of the High Church
English clergy, who, for the most part, so far from troubling
their heads about persecuting people, only think of securing
their tithes, eating their heavy dinners, puffing out their
cheeks with importance on country justice benches, and
occasionally exhibiting their conceited wives, hoyden daughters,
and gawky sons at country balls, whereas
Platitude&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you said in the
public-house that the Church of England was a persecuting Church,
and here in the dingle you have confessed that one section of it
is willing to grant perfect freedom to the exercise of all
religions, and the other only thinks of leading an easy
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saying a thing in the public-house is a widely
different thing from saying it in the dingle,&rdquo; said <!--
page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>the man in black; &ldquo;had the Church of England been
a persecuting Church, it would not stand in the position in which
it stands at present; it might, with its opportunities, have
spread itself over the greater part of the world.&nbsp; I was
about to observe that, instead of practising the indolent habits
of his High Church brethren, Platitude would be working for his
money, preaching the proper use of fire and fagot, or rather of
the halter and the whipping-post, encouraging mobs to attack the
houses of Dissenters, employing spies to collect the scandal of
neighbourhoods, in order that he might use it for sacerdotal
purposes, and, in fact, endeavouring to turn an English parish
into something like a Jesuit benefice in the south of
France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tried that game,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the
parish said &lsquo;Pooh, pooh,&rsquo; and, for the most part,
went over to the Dissenters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the man in black, taking a sip
at his glass, &ldquo;but why were the Dissenters allowed to
preach? why were they not beaten on the lips till they spat out
blood, with a dislodged tooth or two?&nbsp; Why, but because the
authority of the Church of England has, by its own fault, become
so circumscribed, that Mr. Platitude was not able to send a host
of beadles and sbirri to their chapel to bring them to reason, on
which account Mr. Platitude is very properly ashamed of his
Church, and is thinking of uniting himself with one which
possesses more vigour and authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have vigour and authority,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;in foreign lands, but in these kingdoms the day for
practising its atrocities is gone by.&nbsp; It is at present
almost below contempt, and is obliged to sue for grace <i>in
form&acirc; paureris</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 355--><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;but let it once obtain emancipation, and it will cast its
slough, put on its fine clothes, and make converts by
thousands.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a fine Church!&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll
say; &lsquo;with what authority it speaks! no doubts, no
hesitation, no sticking at trifles.&nbsp; What a contrast to the
sleepy English Church!&rsquo;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll go over to it
by millions, till it preponderates here over every other, when it
will of course be voted the dominant one; and then&mdash;and then
. . . &rdquo; and here the man in black drank a considerable
quantity of gin and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;why,
she will be true to herself.&nbsp; Let Dissenters, whether they
be Church of England, as perhaps they may still call themselves,
Methodist, or Presbyterian, presume to grumble, and there shall
be bruising of lips in pulpits, tying up to whipping-posts,
cutting off ears and noses&mdash;he! he! the farce of King Log
has been acted long enough; the time for Queen Stork&rsquo;s
tragedy is drawing nigh;&rdquo; and the man in black sipped his
gin and water in a very exulting manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the Church which, according to your
assertion in the public-house, never persecutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already given you an answer,&rdquo; said the man
in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;With respect to the matter of the
public-house, it is one of the happy privileges of those who
belong to my Church to deny in the public-house what they admit
in the dingle; we have high warranty for such double
speaking.&nbsp; Did not the foundation-stone of our Church, Saint
Peter, deny in the public-house <!-- page 356--><a
name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>what he had
previously professed in the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the people
of England, who have shown aversion to anything in the shape of
intolerance, will permit such barbarities as you have
described?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them become Papists,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;only let the majority become Papists, and you will
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will never become so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the
good sense of the people of England will never permit them to
commit such an absurdity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good sense of the people of England!&rdquo; said
the man in black, filling himself another glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the good sense of not only
the upper, but the middle and lower classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of what description of people are the upper
class?&rdquo; said the man in black, putting a lump of sugar into
his gin and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;monstrously
fine people; so, at least, they are generally believed to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;only those
think them so who don&rsquo;t know them.&nbsp; The male part of
the upper class are in youth a set of heartless profligates; in
old age, a parcel of poor, shaking, nervous paillards.&nbsp; The
female part, worthy to be the sisters and wives of such
wretches&mdash;unmarried, full of cold vice, kept under by vanity
and ambition, but which, after marriage, they seek not to
restrain; in old age, abandoned to vapours and horrors; do you
think that such beings will afford any obstacle to the progress
of the Church in these regions, as soon as her movements are
unfettered?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>&ldquo;I cannot give an opinion; I know nothing of
them, except from a distance.&nbsp; But what think you of the
middle classes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their chief characteristic,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;is a rage for grandeur and gentility; and that same
rage makes us quite sure of them in the long-run.&nbsp;
Everything that&rsquo;s lofty meets their unqualified
approbation; whilst everything humble, or, as they call it,
&lsquo;low,&rsquo; is scouted by them.&nbsp; They begin to have a
vague idea that the religion which they have hitherto professed
is low; at any rate, that it is not the religion of the mighty
ones of the earth, of the great kings and emperors whose shoes
they have a vast inclination to kiss, nor was used by the grand
personages of whom they have read in their novels and romances,
their Ivanhoes, their Marmions, and their Ladies of the
Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that the writings of Scott have had any
influence in modifying their religious opinions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly I do,&rdquo; said the man in
black.&nbsp; &ldquo;The writings of that man have made them
greater fools than they were before.&nbsp; All their conversation
now is about gallant knights, princesses, and cavaliers, with
which his pages are stuffed&mdash;all of whom were Papists, or
very High Church, which is nearly the same thing; and they are
beginning to think that the religion of such nice sweet-scented
gentry must be something very superfine.&nbsp; Why, I know at
Birmingham the daughter of an ironmonger, who screeches to the
piano the Lady of the Lake&rsquo;s hymn to the Virgin Mary,
always weeps when Mary Queen of Scots is mentioned, and fasts on
the anniversary of the death of that very wise martyr, Charles
the First.&nbsp; Why, I <!-- page 358--><a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>would
engage to convert such an idiot to popery in a week, were it
worth my trouble.&nbsp; <i>O Cavali&egrave;re Gualtiero avete
fatto molto in favore della Santa Sede</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;he has done it
unwittingly; I never heard before that he was a favourer of the
popish delusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only in theory,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Trust any of the clan Mac-Sycophant for interfering openly
and boldly in favour of any cause on which the sun does not shine
benignantly.&nbsp; Popery is at present, as you say, suing for
grace in these regions <i>in form&acirc; pauperis</i>; but let
royalty once take it up, let old gouty George once patronise it,
and I would consent to drink puddle-water if, the very next time
the canny Scot was admitted to the royal symposium, he did not
say, &lsquo;By my faith, yere Majesty, I have always thought, at
the bottom of my heart, that popery, as ill-scrapit tongues
ca&rsquo; it, was a very grand religion; I shall be proud to
follow your Majesty&rsquo;s example in adopting
it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt not,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that both gouty
George and his devoted servant will be mouldering in their tombs
long before royalty in England thinks about adopting
popery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can wait,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;in
these days of rampant gentility, there will be no want of kings
nor of Scots about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not Walters,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our work has been already tolerably well done by
one,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but if we wanted
literature, we should never lack in these regions hosts of
literary men of some kind or other to eulogise us, provided our
religion were in the <!-- page 359--><a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>fashion, and our popish nobles
chose&mdash;and they always do our bidding&mdash;to admit the
canaille to their tables&mdash;their kitchen tables.&nbsp; As for
literature in general,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Santa Sede is
not particularly partial to it, it may be employed both
ways.&nbsp; In Italy, in particular, it has discovered that
literary men are not always disposed to be
lick-spittles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example, Dante,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;a dangerous
personage; that poem of his cuts both ways; and then there was
Pulci, that Morgante of his cuts both ways, or rather one way,
and that sheer against us; and then there was Aretino, who dealt
so hard with the poveri frati; all writers, at least Italian
ones, are not lick-spittles.&nbsp; And then in
Spain,&mdash;&rsquo;tis true, Lope de Vega and Calderon were most
inordinate lick-spittles; the Principe Constante of the last is a
curiosity in its way; and then the Mary Stuart of Lope; I think I
shall recommend the perusal of that work to the Birmingham
ironmonger&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;she has been lately thinking of
adding &lsquo;a slight knowledge of the magneeficent language of
the Peninsula&rsquo; to the rest of her accomplishments, he! he!
he!&nbsp; But then there was Cervantes, starving, but straight;
he deals us some hard knocks in that second part of his
Quixote.&nbsp; Then there were some of the writers of the
picaresque novels.&nbsp; No, all literary men are not
lick-spittles, whether in Italy or Spain, or, indeed, upon the
Continent; it is only in England that all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;mind what you are about to
say of English literary men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I mind?&rdquo; said the man in black, <!--
page 360--><a name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
360</span>&ldquo;there are no literary men here.&nbsp; I have
heard of literary men living in garrets, but not in dingles,
whatever philologists may do; I may, therefore, speak out
freely.&nbsp; It is only in England that literary men are
invariably lick-spittles; on which account, perhaps, they are so
despised, even by those who benefit by their dirty
services.&nbsp; Look at your fashionable novel writers, he!
he!&mdash;and, above all, at your newspaper editors, ho!
ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, of course, except the editors of the --- from
your censure of the last class?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;why, they
might serve as models in the dirty trade to all the rest who
practise it.&nbsp; See how they bepraise their patrons, the grand
Whig nobility, who hope, by raising the cry of liberalism, and by
putting themselves at the head of the populace, to come into
power shortly.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to be hard, at present,
upon those Whigs,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;for they are
playing our game; but a time will come when, not wanting them, we
will kick them to a considerable distance: and then, when
toleration is no longer the cry, and the Whigs are no longer
backed by the populace, see whether the editors of the --- will
stand by them; they will prove themselves as expert lick-spittles
of despotism as of liberalism.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think they will
always bespatter the Tories and Austria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am sorry to find that you
entertain so low an opinion of the spirit of English literary
men; we will now return, if you please, to the subject of the
middle classes; I think your strictures upon them in general are
rather too sweeping&mdash;they are not altogether the foolish
<!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
361</span>people which you have described.&nbsp; Look, for
example, at that very powerful and numerous body the Dissenters,
the descendants of those sturdy Patriots who hurled Charles the
Simple from his throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are some sturdy fellows amongst them, I do not
deny,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;especially amongst the
preachers, clever withal&mdash;two or three of that class nearly
drove Mr. Platitude mad, as perhaps you are aware, but they are
not very numerous; and the old sturdy sort of preachers are fast
dropping off, and, as we observe with pleasure, are generally
succeeded by frothy coxcombs, whom it would not be very difficult
to gain over.&nbsp; But what we most rely upon as an instrument
to bring the Dissenters over to us is the mania for gentility,
which amongst them has of late become as great, and more
ridiculous than amongst the middle classes belonging to the
Church of England.&nbsp; All the plain and simple fashions of
their forefathers they are either about to abandon, or have
already done so.&nbsp; Look at the most part of their
chapels&mdash;no longer modest brick edifices, situated in quiet
and retired streets, but lunatic-looking erections, in what the
simpletons call the modern Gothic taste, of Portland stone, with
a cross upon the top, and the site generally the most conspicuous
that can be found.&nbsp; And look at the manner in which they
educate their children&mdash;I mean those that are wealthy.&nbsp;
They do not even wish them to be Dissenters&mdash;&lsquo;the
sweet dears shall enjoy the advantages of good society, of which
their parents were debarred.&rsquo;&nbsp; So the girls are sent
to tip-top boarding-schools, where amongst other trash they read
&lsquo;Rokeby,&rsquo; and are taught <!-- page 362--><a
name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 362</span>to sing
snatches from that high-flying ditty, the
&lsquo;Cavalier&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Would you match the base Skippon, and
Massey, and Brown,<br />
With the barons of England, who fight for the
crown?&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he! he! their own names.&nbsp; Whilst the lads are sent to
those hot-beds of pride and folly&mdash;colleges, whence they
return with a greater contempt for everything &lsquo;low,&rsquo;
and especially for their own pedigree, than they went with.&nbsp;
I tell you, friend, the children of Dissenters, if not their
parents, are going over to the Church, as you call it, and the
Church is going over to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see the justice of that latter assertion at
all,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;some of the Dissenters&rsquo; children
may be coming over to the Church of England, and yet the Church
of England be very far from going over to Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the high road for it, I assure you,&rdquo; said the
man in black; &ldquo;part of it is going to abandon, the rest to
lose their prerogative, and when a Church no longer retains its
prerogative, it speedily loses its own respect, and that of
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if the higher classes have
all the vices and follies which you represent, on which point I
can say nothing, as I have never mixed with them; and even
supposing the middle classes are the foolish beings you would
fain make them, and which I do not believe them as a body to be,
you would still find some resistance amongst the lower classes: I
have a considerable respect for their good sense and independence
of character; but pray let me hear your opinion of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the lower classes,&rdquo; said the man in <!--
page 363--><a name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
363</span>black, &ldquo;I believe them to be the most brutal
wretches in the world, the most addicted to foul feeding, foul
language, and foul vices of every kind; wretches who have neither
love for country, religion, nor anything save their own vile
selves.&nbsp; You surely do not think that they would oppose a
change of religion! why, there is not one of them but would
hurrah for the Pope, or Mahomet, for the sake of a hearty gorge
and a drunken bout, like those which they are treated with at
election contests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your Church any followers amongst them?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever there happens to be a Romish family of
considerable possessions,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;our Church is sure to have followers of the lower class,
who have come over in the hope of getting something in the shape
of dole or donation.&nbsp; As, however, the Romish is not yet the
dominant religion, and the clergy of the English establishment
have some patronage to bestow, the churches are not quite
deserted by the lower classes; yet, were the Romish to become the
established religion, they would, to a certainty, all go over to
it; you can scarcely imagine what a self-interested set they
are&mdash;for example, the landlord of that public-house in which
I first met you, having lost a sum of money upon a cockfight, and
his affairs in consequence being in a bad condition, is on the
eve of coming over to us, in the hope that two old popish females
of property, whom I confess, will advance a sum of money to set
him up again in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what could have put such an idea into the poor
fellow&rsquo;s head?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 364--><a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>&ldquo;Oh! he and I have had some conversation upon the
state of his affairs,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;I
think he might make a rather useful convert in these parts,
provided things take a certain turn, as they doubtless
will.&nbsp; It is no bad thing to have a fighting fellow, who
keeps a public-house, belonging to one&rsquo;s religion.&nbsp; He
has been occasionally employed as a bully at elections by the
Tory party, and he may serve us in the same capacity.&nbsp; The
fellow comes of a good stock; I heard him say that his father
headed the High Church mob who sacked and burnt Priestley&rsquo;s
house at Birmingham, towards the end of the last
century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A disgraceful affair,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a disgraceful affair?&rdquo; said
the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;I assure you that nothing has
occurred for the last fifty years which has given the High Church
party so much credit in the eyes of Rome as that,&mdash;we did
not imagine that the fellows had so much energy.&nbsp; Had they
followed up that affair by twenty others of a similar kind, they
would by this time have had everything in their own power; but
they did not, and, as a necessary consequence, they are reduced
to almost nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that your Church would
have acted very differently in its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has always done so,&rdquo; said the man in black,
coolly sipping.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Church has always armed the
brute population against the genius and intellect of a country,
provided that same intellect and genius were not willing to
become its instruments and eulogists; and provided we once obtain
a firm hold here again, we would not fail to do so.&nbsp; We
would occasionally stuff the beastly rabble with <!-- page
365--><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>horseflesh and bitter ale, and then halloo them on
against all those who were obnoxious to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horseflesh and bitter ale!&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;horseflesh
and bitter ale&mdash;the favourite delicacies of their Saxon
ancestors, who were always ready to do our bidding after a
liberal allowance of such cheer.&nbsp; There is a tradition in
our Church, that before the Northumbrian rabble, at the
instigation of Austin, attacked and massacred the Presbyterian
monks of Bangor, they had been allowed a good gorge of horseflesh
and bitter ale.&nbsp; He! he! he!&rdquo; continued the man in
black, &ldquo;what a fine spectacle to see such a mob, headed by
a fellow like our friend the landlord, sack the house of another
Priestley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t deny that we have had a
Priestley,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and admit the possibility of our
having another?&nbsp; You were lately observing that all English
literary men were sycophants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lick-spittles,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;yes, I admit that you have had a Priestley, but he was a
Dissenter of the old class; you have had him, and perhaps may
have another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we may,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;But with
respect to the lower classes, have you mixed much with
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mixed with all classes,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;and with the lower not less than the upper and
middle; they are much as I have described them; and of the three,
the lower are the worst.&nbsp; I never knew one of them that
possessed the slightest principle, no, not . . . It is true,
there was one fellow whom I once met, who . . . but it is a long
story, and the affair happened abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 366--><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
366</span>&ldquo;I ought to know something of the English
people,&rdquo; he continued, after a moment&rsquo;s pause;
&ldquo;I have been many years amongst them, labouring in the
cause of the Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your See must have had great confidence in your powers,
when it selected you to labour for it in these parts,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They chose me,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;principally because, being of British extraction and
education, I could speak the English language and bear a glass of
something strong.&nbsp; It is the opinion of my See, that it
would hardly do to send a missionary into a country like this who
is not well versed in English&mdash;a country where, they think,
so far from understanding any language besides his own, scarcely
one individual in ten speaks his own intelligibly; or an ascetic
person where, as they say, high and low, male and female, are, at
some period of their lives, fond of a renovating glass, as it is
styled&mdash;in other words, of tippling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your See appears to entertain a very strange opinion of
the English,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not altogether an unjust one,&rdquo; said the man in
black, lifting the glass to his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is certainly very kind
on its part to wish to bring back such a set of beings beneath
its wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to the kindness of my See,&rdquo; said the man
in black, &ldquo;I have not much to say; my See has generally in
what it does a tolerably good motive; these heretics possess in
plenty what my See has a great hankering for, and can turn to a
good account&mdash;money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Founder of the Christian religion cared nothing for
money,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><!-- page 367--><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>&ldquo;What have we to do with what the Founder of the
Christian religion cared for?&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How could our temples be built, and our priests supported
without money?&nbsp; But you are unwise to reproach us with a
desire of obtaining money; you forget that your own Church, if
the Church of England be your own Church, as I suppose it is,
from the willingness which you displayed in the public-house to
fight for it, is equally avaricious; look at your greedy bishops,
and your corpulent rectors&mdash;do they imitate Christ in His
disregard for money?&nbsp; You might as well tell me that they
imitate Christ in His meekness and humility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whatever their faults may
be, you can&rsquo;t say that they go to Rome for
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black made no direct answer, but appeared by the
motion of his lips to be repeating something to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your glass is again empty,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;perhaps you will replenish it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black arose from his seat, adjusted his
habiliments, which were rather in disorder, and placed upon his
head his hat, which he had laid aside; then, looking at me, who
was still lying on the ground, he said&mdash;&ldquo;I might,
perhaps, take another glass, though I believe I have had quite as
much as I can well bear; but I do not wish to hear you utter
anything more this evening, after that last observation of
yours&mdash;it is quite original; I will meditate upon it on my
pillow this night, after having said an ave and a pater&mdash;go
to Rome for money!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then made Belle a low bow,
slightly motioned to me with his hand as if bidding <!-- page
368--><a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>farewell, and then left the dingle with rather uneven
steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Rome for money,&rdquo; I heard him say as he
ascended the winding path, &ldquo;he! he! he!&nbsp; Go to Rome
for money, ho! ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>

Olive&mdash;What Do You Mean?&mdash;Koul Adonai&mdash;The Thick

<p>Nearly three days elapsed without anything of particular
moment occurring.&nbsp; Belle drove the little cart containing
her merchandise about the neighbourhood, returning to the dingle
towards the evening.&nbsp; As for myself, I kept within my wooded
retreat, working during the periods of her absence leisurely at
my forge.&nbsp; Having observed that the quadruped which my
companion drove was as much in need of shoes as my own had been
some time previously, I had determined to provide it with a set,
and during the aforesaid periods occupied myself in preparing
them.&nbsp; As I was employed three mornings and afternoons about
them, I am sure that the reader will agree that I worked
leisurely, or rather, lazily.&nbsp; On the third day Belle
arrived somewhat later than usual; I was lying on my back at the
bottom of the dingle, employed in tossing up the shoes which I
had produced, and catching them as they fell&mdash;some being
always in the air mounting or descending, somewhat after the
fashion of the waters of a fountain.</p>
<p><!-- page 370--><a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span>&ldquo;Why have you been absent so long?&rdquo; said I
to Belle; &ldquo;it must be long past four by the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been almost killed by the heat,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;I was never out in a more sultry day&mdash;the poor
donkey, too, could scarcely move along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall have fresh shoes,&rdquo; said I, continuing my
exercise; &ldquo;here they are quite ready; to-morrow I will tack
them on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why are you playing with them in that
manner?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partly in triumph at having made them, and partly to
show that I can do something besides making them; it is not every
one who, after having made a set of horse-shoes, can keep them
going up and down in the air, without letting one
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One has now fallen on your chin,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another on my cheek,&rdquo; said I, getting up;
&ldquo;it is time to discontinue the game, for the last shoe drew
blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle went to her own little encampment; and as for myself,
after having flung the donkey&rsquo;s shoes into my tent, I put
some fresh wood on the fire, which was nearly out, and hung the
kettle over it.&nbsp; I then issued forth from the dingle, and
strolled round the wood that surrounded it; for a long time I was
busied in meditation, looking at the ground, striking with my
foot, half unconsciously, the tufts of grass and thistles that I
met in my way.&nbsp; After some time, I lifted up my eyes to the
sky, at first vacantly, and then with more attention, turning my
head in all directions for a minute or two; after which I
returned to the dingle.&nbsp; Isopel was seated near the fire,
over which the kettle was now hung; she had changed her
dress&mdash;no signs of the dust and fatigue of her late
excursion remained; she <!-- page 371--><a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>had just
added to the fire a small billet of wood, two or three of which I
had left beside it; the fire cracked, and a sweet odour filled
the dingle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am fond of sitting by a wood fire,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;when abroad, whether it be hot or cold; I love to see the
flames dart out of the wood; but what kind is this, and where did
you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ash,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;green ash.&nbsp;
Somewhat less than a week ago, whilst I was wandering along the
road by the side of a wood, I came to a place where some peasants
were engaged in cutting up and clearing away a confused mass of
fallen timber: a mighty aged oak had given way the night before,
and in its fall had shivered some smaller trees; the upper part
of the oak, and the fragments of the rest, lay across the
road.&nbsp; I purchased, for a trifle, a bundle or two, and the
wood on the fire is part of it&mdash;ash, green ash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes good the old rhyme,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;which I have heard sung by the old women in the great
house:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ash, when green,<br />
Is fire for a queen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And on fairer form of queen, ash fire never
shone,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than on thine, O beauteous queen of
the dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am half disposed to be angry with you, young
man,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not entirely?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Belle made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
had no objection to the first part of the speech, but you did not
like being called queen of the dingle.&nbsp; Well, if I had the
power, I would make you queen <!-- page 372--><a
name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 372</span>of
something better than the dingle&mdash;Queen of China.&nbsp;
Come, let us have tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something less would content me,&rdquo; said Belle,
sighing, as she rose to prepare our evening meal.</p>
<p>So we took tea together, Belle and I.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
delicious tea is after a hot summer&rsquo;s day, and a long
walk,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is most refreshing then,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;but I have heard people say that they most enjoy it on a
cold winter&rsquo;s night, when the kettle is hissing on the
fire, and their children playing on the hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where does tea come from?&rdquo;
she presently demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From China,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I just now mentioned
it, and the mention of it put me in mind of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of country is China?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very little about it; all I know is, that it is
a very large country far to the East, but scarcely large enough
to contain its inhabitants, who are so numerous, that though
China does not cover one-ninth part of the world, its inhabitants
amount to one-third of the population of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do they talk as we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&nbsp; I know nothing of their language; but I
have heard that it is quite different from all others, and so
difficult that none but the cleverest people amongst foreigners
can master it, on which account, perhaps, only the French pretend
to know anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the French so very clever, then?&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say there are no people like them, at least in
Europe.&nbsp; But talking of Chinese reminds <!-- page 373--><a
name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>me that I
have not for some time past given you a lesson in Armenian.&nbsp;
The word for tea in Armenian is&mdash;by the bye, what is the
Armenian word for tea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair, not mine,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;it seems hard that the master should ask the
scholar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whatever the word may be in
Armenian, it is a noun; and as we have never yet declined an
Armenian noun together, we may as well take this opportunity of
declining one.&nbsp; Belle, there are ten declensions in
Armenian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a declension?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way of declining a noun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in the civilest way imaginable, I decline the
noun.&nbsp; Is that a declension?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should never play on words; to do so is low,
vulgar, smelling of the pothouse, the workhouse.&nbsp; Belle, I
insist on your declining an Armenian noun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done so already,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go on in this way,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall
decline taking any more tea with you.&nbsp; Will you decline an
Armenian noun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the language,&rdquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you must teach me languages, why not teach
me French or Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of Chinese; and as for French, none but
a Frenchman is clever enough to speak it&mdash;to say nothing of
teaching; no, we will stick to Armenian, unless, indeed, you
would prefer Welsh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welsh, I have heard, is vulgar,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;so, if I must learn one of the two, I will prefer
Armenian, which I never heard of till you <!-- page 374--><a
name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 374</span>mentioned
it to me; though, of the two, I really think Welsh sounds
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Armenian noun,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which I
propose for your declension this night, is ---, which signifieth
Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither like the word nor the sound,&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it is
the word I choose: Master, with all its variations, being the
first noun the sound of which I would have you learn from my
lips.&nbsp; Come, let us begin&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A master.&nbsp; Of a master, etc.&nbsp;
Repeat&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not much used to say the word,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;but to oblige you I will decline it as you wish;&rdquo;
and thereupon Belle declined Master in Armenian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have declined the noun very well,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;that is, in the singular number; we will now go to the
plural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the plural?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That which implies more than one, for example, Masters;
you shall now go through Masters in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;never; it is bad to
have one master, but more I would never bear, whether in Armenian
or English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I merely
want you to decline Masters in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do decline them; I will have nothing to do with them,
nor with Master either; I was wrong to . . . What sound is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not hear it, but I dare say it is thunder; in
Armenian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what it is in Armenian; but why do you think
it is thunder?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
375</span>&ldquo;Ere I returned from my stroll, I looked up into
the heavens, and by their appearance I judged that a storm was
nigh at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why did you not tell me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never asked me about the state of the atmosphere,
and I am not in the habit of giving my opinion to people on any
subject, unless questioned.&nbsp; But, setting that aside, can
you blame me for not troubling you with forebodings about storm
and tempest, which might have prevented the pleasure you promised
yourself in drinking tea, or perhaps a lesson in Armenian, though
you pretend to dislike the latter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dislike is not pretended,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;I hate the sound of it, but I love my tea, and it was kind
of you not to wish to cast a cloud over my little pleasures; the
thunder came quite time enough to interrupt it without being
anticipated&mdash;there is another peal&mdash;I will clear away,
and see that my tent is in a condition to resist the storm; and I
think you had better bestir yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isopel departed, and I remained seated on my stone, as nothing
belonging to myself required any particular attention; in about a
quarter of an hour she returned, and seated herself upon her
stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dark the place is become since I left you,&rdquo;
said she; &ldquo;just as if night were just at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look up at the sky,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and you will
not wonder; it is all of a deep olive.&nbsp; The wind is
beginning to rise; hark how it moans among the branches, and see
how their tops are bending; it brings dust on its wings&mdash;I
felt some fall on my face; and what is this, a drop of
rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 376--><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
376</span>&ldquo;We shall have plenty anon,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;do you hear? it already begins to hiss upon the embers;
that fire of ours will soon be extinguished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not probable that we shall want it,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;but we had better seek shelter: let us go into my
tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but you go in alone;
as for me, I will seek my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to be afraid of
me; I have taught you to decline Master in Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You almost tempt me,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;to make
you decline mistress in English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make matters short,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I decline
a mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Belle, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have merely done what you wished me,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and in your own style; there is no other way of declining
anything in English, for in English there are no
declensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain is increasing,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I shall go to my tent;
you may come if you please; I do assure you I am not afraid of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I of you,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;so I will
come.&nbsp; Why should I be afraid?&nbsp; I can take my own part;
that is . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>We went into the tent and sat down, and now the rain began to
pour with vehemence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope we shall not be flooded
in this hollow,&rdquo; said I to Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no
fear of that,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;the wandering people,
amongst other names, call it the dry hollow.&nbsp; I believe
there is a passage somewhere or other by which the wet is carried
<!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
377</span>off.&nbsp; There must be a cloud right above us, it is
so dark.&nbsp; Oh! what a flash!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a peal!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;that is what the
Hebrews call Koul Adonai&mdash;the voice of the Lord.&nbsp; Are
you afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I rather like to hear
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am fond of the
sound of thunder myself.&nbsp; There is nothing like it; Koul
Adonai behadar: the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice, as the
Prayer-Book version hath it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something awful in it,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;and then the lightning&mdash;the whole dingle is now in a
blaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve,
and discovereth the thick bushes.&rsquo;&nbsp; As you say, there
is something awful in thunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are all kinds of noises above us,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;surely I heard the crashing of a tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar
trees,&rsquo;&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but what you hear is caused
by a convulsion of the air; during a thunderstorm there are
occasionally all kinds of a&euml;rial noises.&nbsp; Ab Gwilym,
who, next to King David, has best described a thunderstorm,
speaks of these a&euml;rial noises in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Astonied now I stand at strains,<br />
As of ten thousand clanking chains;<br />
And once, methought, that overthrown,<br />
The welkin&rsquo;s oaks came whelming down;<br />
Upon my head up starts my hair:<br />
Why hunt abroad the hounds of air?<br />
What curs&egrave;d hag is screeching high,<br />
Whilst crash goes all her crockery?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would hardly believe, Belle, that though I <!-- page
378--><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>offered at least ten thousand lines nearly as good as
those to the booksellers in London, the simpletons were so blind
to their interest as to refuse purchasing them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;especially if such dreadful expressions frequently occur
as that towards the end;&mdash;surely that was the crash of a
tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there falls the cedar
tree&mdash;I mean the sallow; one of the tall trees on the
outside of the dingle has been snapped short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;that the fine
old oak, which you saw the peasants cutting up, gave way the
other night, when scarcely a breath of air was stirring; how much
better to have fallen in a storm like this, the fiercest I
remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;after
braving a thousand tempests, it was meeter for it to fall of
itself than to be vanquished at last.&nbsp; But to return to Ab
Gwilym&rsquo;s poetry: he was above culling dainty words, and
spoke boldly his mind on all subjects.&nbsp; Enraged with the
thunder for parting him and Morfydd, he says, at the conclusion
of his ode,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My curse, O Thunder, cling to thee,<br />
For parting my dear pearl and me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You and I shall part, that is, I shall go to my tent,
if you persist in repeating from him.&nbsp; The man must have
been a savage.&nbsp; A poor wood-pigeon has fallen
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there he lies, just outside
the tent; often have I listened to his note when alone in this
wilderness.&nbsp; So you do not like Ab Gwilym; what say you to
old Goethe:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>&lsquo;Mist shrouds the night, and
rack;<br />
Hear, in the woods, what an awful crack!<br />
Wildly the owls are flitting,<br />
Hark to the pillars splitting<br />
Of palaces verdant ever,<br />
The branches quiver and sever,<br />
The mighty stems are creaking,<br />
The poor roots breaking and shrieking,<br />
In wild mixt ruin down dashing,<br />
O&rsquo;er one another they&rsquo;re crashing;<br />
Whilst &rsquo;midst the rocks so hoary,<br />
Whirlwinds hurry and worry.<br />
Hear&rsquo;st not, sister&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;hark!&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hear&rsquo;st not, sister, a
chorus<br />
Of voices&mdash;?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but I hear a
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 380--><a name="page380"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 380</span>CHAPTER XCVI</h2>
<p>A shout&mdash;A Fire-Ball&mdash;See to the
Horses&mdash;Passing Away&mdash;Gap in the Hedge&mdash;On Three
Wheels&mdash;Why Do You Stop?&mdash;No Craven Heart&mdash;The
Cordial&mdash;Across the Country&mdash;Small Bags.</p>
<p>I listened attentively, but I could hear nothing but the loud
clashing of branches, the pattering of rain, and the muttered
growl of thunder.&nbsp; I was about to tell Belle that she must
have been mistaken, when I heard a shout&mdash;indistinct, it is
true, owing to the noises aforesaid&mdash;from some part of the
field above the dingle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will soon see what&rsquo;s
the matter,&rdquo; said I to Belle, starting up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
will go too,&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay where you
are,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if I need you, I will call;&rdquo;
and, without waiting for any answer, I hurried to the mouth of
the dingle.&nbsp; I was about a few yards only from the top of
the ascent, when I beheld a blaze of light, from whence I knew
not; the next moment there was a loud crash, and I appeared
involved in a cloud of sulphurous smoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord have
mercy upon us!&rdquo; I heard a voice say, and methought I heard
the plunging and struggling of horses.&nbsp; I had stopped short
on hearing the crash, for I was half stunned; but I now hurried
forward, and in a moment stood upon the plain.&nbsp; Here I was
instantly aware of <!-- page 381--><a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>the cause of the crash and the
smoke.&nbsp; One of those balls, generally called fire-balls, had
fallen from the clouds, and was burning on the plain at a short
distance; and the voice which I had heard, and the plunging, were
as easily accounted for.&nbsp; Near the left-hand corner of the
grove which surrounded the dingle, and about ten yards from the
fire-ball, I perceived a chaise, with a postillion on the box,
who was making efforts, apparently useless, to control his
horses, which were kicking and plunging in the highest degree of
excitement.&nbsp; I instantly ran towards the chaise, in order to
offer what help was in my power.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help me,&rdquo;
said the poor fellow, as I drew nigh; but before I could reach
the horses, they had turned rapidly round, one of the fore-wheels
flew from its axle-tree, the chaise was overset, and the
postillion flung violently from his seat upon the field.&nbsp;
The horses now became more furious than before, kicking
desperately, and endeavouring to disengage themselves from the
fallen chaise.&nbsp; As I was hesitating whether to run to the
assistance of the postillion or endeavour to disengage the
animals, I heard the voice of Belle exclaiming, &ldquo;See to the
horses; I will look after the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had, it
seems, been alarmed by the crash which accompanied the fire-bolt,
and had hurried up to learn the cause.&nbsp; I forthwith seized
the horses by the heads, and used all the means I possessed to
soothe and pacify them, employing every gentle modulation of
which my voice was capable.&nbsp; Belle, in the meantime, had
raised up the man, who was much stunned by his fall; but,
presently recovering his recollection to a certain degree, he
came limping to me, holding his hand to his right thigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The <!-- page 382--><a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>first thing that must now be
done,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is to free these horses from the
traces; can you undertake to do so?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I
can,&rdquo; said the man, looking at me somewhat stupidly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will help,&rdquo; said Belle, and without loss of time
laid hold of one of the traces.&nbsp; The man, after a short
pause, also set to work, and in a few minutes the horses were
extricated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I to the man,
&ldquo;what is next to be done?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;indeed, I scarcely know anything; I
have been so frightened by this horrible storm, and so shaken by
my fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
the storm is passing away, so cast your fears away too; and as
for your fall, you must bear it as lightly as you can.&nbsp; I
will tie the horses amongst those trees, and then we will all
betake us to the hollow below.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what&rsquo;s to become of my chaise?&rdquo; said the postillion,
looking ruefully on the fallen vehicle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us leave
the chaise for the present,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we can be of no
use to it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave my
chaise lying on the ground in this weather,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;I love my chaise, and him whom it belongs to.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are quite right to be fond of yourself,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;on which account I advise you to seek shelter from the
rain as soon as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was not talking
of myself,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;but my master, to whom the
chaise belongs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you called the
chaise yours,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my way of
speaking,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but the chaise is my
master&rsquo;s, and a better master does not live.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you think we could manage to raise up the
chaise?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what is to become of the
horses?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love my horses well
enough,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;but <!-- page 383--><a
name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>they will
take less harm than the chaise.&nbsp; We two can never lift up
that chaise.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But we three can,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;at least, I think so; and I know where to find two
poles which will assist us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better go
to the tent,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will be wet
through.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I care not for a little
wetting,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;moreover, I have more gowns
than one&mdash;see you after the horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon,
I led the horses past the mouth of the dingle, to a place where a
gap in the hedge afforded admission to the copse or plantation on
the southern side.&nbsp; Forcing them through the gap, I led them
to a spot amidst the trees, which I deemed would afford them the
most convenient place for standing; then, darting down into the
dingle, I brought up a rope, and also the halter of my own nag,
and with these fastened them each to a separate tree in the best
manner I could.&nbsp; This done, I returned to the chaise and the
postillion.&nbsp; In a minute or two Belle arrived with two
poles, which, it seems, had long been lying, overgrown with
brushwood, in a ditch or hollow behind the plantation.&nbsp; With
these both she and I set to work in endeavouring to raise the
fallen chaise from the ground.</p>
<p>We experienced considerable difficulty in this undertaking; at
length, with the assistance of the postillion, we saw our efforts
crowned with success&mdash;the chaise was lifted up, and stood
upright on three wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may leave it here in safety,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;for it will hardly move away on three wheels, even
supposing it could run by itself; I am afraid there is work here
for a wheelwright, in which case I cannot assist you; if you were
in need of a blacksmith it would be otherwise.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think either <!-- page 384--><a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>the wheel
or the axle is hurt,&rdquo; said the postillion, who had been
handling both; &ldquo;it is only the linch-pin having dropped out
that caused the wheel to fly off; if I could but find the
linch-pin!&mdash;though, perhaps, it fell out a mile
away.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
never mind the linch-pin, I can make you one, or something that
will serve: but I can&rsquo;t stay here any longer; I am going to
my place below with this young gentlewoman, and you had better
follow us.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; said the man;
and after lifting up the wheel and propping it against the
chaise, he went with us, slightly limping, and with his hand
pressed to his thigh.</p>
<p>As we were descending the narrow path, Belle leading the way,
and myself the last of the party, the postillion suddenly stopped
short, and looked about him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you stop?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to offend you,&rdquo;
said the man, &ldquo;but this seems to be a strange place you are
leading me into; I hope you and the young gentlewoman, as you
call her, don&rsquo;t mean me any harm&mdash;you seemed in a
great hurry to bring me here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We wished to
get you out of the rain,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and ourselves too;
that is, if we can, which I rather doubt, for the canvas of a
tent is slight shelter in such a rain; but what harm should we
wish to do you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You may think I have
money,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and I have some, but only
thirty shillings, and for a sum like that it would be hardly
worth while to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;thirty shillings,
after all, are thirty shillings, and for what I know, half a
dozen throats may have been cut in this place for that sum at the
rate of five shillings each; moreover, there are the horses,
which would serve to establish this young gentlewoman and myself
in <!-- page 385--><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>housekeeping, provided we were thinking of such a
thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I suppose I have fallen into
pretty hands,&rdquo; said the man, putting himself in a posture
of defence; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll show no craven heart; and if
you attempt to lay hands on me, I&rsquo;ll try to pay you in your
own coin.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m rather lamed in the leg, but I can
still use my fists; so come on both of you, man and woman, if
woman this be, though she looks more like a grenadier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear no more of this nonsense,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;if you are afraid, you can go back to your
chaise&mdash;we only seek to do you a kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he was just now talking of cutting throats,&rdquo;
said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;You brought it on yourself,&rdquo;
said Belle; &ldquo;you suspected us, and he wished to pass a joke
upon you; he would not hurt a hair of your head, were your coach
laden with gold, nor would I.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said the man, &ldquo;I was wrong&mdash;here&rsquo;s my hand to
both of you,&rdquo; shaking us by the hands.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you where you please, but I thought
this a strange lonesome place, though I ought not much to mind
strange lonesome places, having been in plenty of such when I was
a servant in Italy, without coming to any harm&mdash;come, let us
move on, for &rsquo;tis a shame to keep you two in the
rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So we descended the path which led into the depths of the
dingle; at the bottom I conducted the postillion to my tent,
which, though the rain dripped and trickled through it, afforded
some shelter; there I bade him sit down on the log of wood,
whilst I placed myself as usual on my stone.&nbsp; Belle in the
meantime had repaired to her own place of abode.&nbsp; After a
little time, I produced a <!-- page 386--><a
name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>bottle of
the cordial of which I have previously had occasion to speak, and
made my guest take a considerable draught.&nbsp; I then offered
him some bread and cheese, which he accepted with thanks.&nbsp;
In about an hour the rain had much abated.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do
you now propose to do?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I scarcely
know,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;I suppose I must endeavour to
put on the wheel with your help.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How far are
you from your home?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upwards of
thirty miles,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;my master keeps an inn
on the Great North Road, and from thence I started early this
morning with a family, which I conveyed across the country to a
hall at some distance from here.&nbsp; On my return I was beset
by the thunderstorm, which frightened the horses, who dragged the
chaise off the road to the field above, and overset it as you
saw.&nbsp; I had proposed to pass the night at an inn about
twelve miles from here on my way back, though how I am to get
there to-night I scarcely know, even if we can put on the wheel,
for, to tell you the truth, I am shaken by my fall, and the
smoulder and smoke of that fire-ball have rather bewildered my
head; I am, moreover, not much acquainted with the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is to
pass the night here; I will presently light a fire, and endeavour
to make you comfortable&mdash;in the morning we will see to your
wheel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I
shall be glad to pass the night here, provided I do not intrude,
but I must see to the horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I conducted
the man to the place where the horses were tied.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
trees drip very much upon them,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;and
it will not do for them to remain here all night; they will <!--
page 387--><a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>be better out on the field picking the grass; but first
of all they must have a good feed of corn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon
he went to his chaise, from which he presently brought two small
bags, partly filled with corn&mdash;into them he inserted the
mouths of the horses, tying them over their heads.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here we will leave them for a time,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;when I think they have had enough, I will come back, tie
their fore-legs, and let them pick about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It might be about ten o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; Belle, the
postillion, and myself sat just within the tent, by a fire of
charcoal which I had kindled in the chafing-pan.&nbsp; The man
had removed the harness from his horses, and, after tethering
their legs, had left them for the night in the field above to
regale themselves on what grass they could find.&nbsp; The rain
had long since entirely ceased, and the moon and stars shone
bright in the firmament, up to which, putting aside the canvas, I
occasionally looked from the depths of the dingle.&nbsp; Large
drops of water, however, falling now and then upon the tent from
the neighbouring trees, would have served, could we have
forgotten it, to remind us of the recent storm, and also a
certain chilliness in the atmosphere, unusual to the season,
proceeding from the moisture with which the ground was saturated;
yet these circumstances only served to make our party enjoy the
charcoal fire the more.&nbsp; There we sat bending over it:
Belle, with her long beautiful <!-- page 389--><a
name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 389</span>hair
streaming over her magnificent shoulders; the postillion smoking
his pipe, in his shirt-sleeves and waistcoat, having flung aside
his great-coat, which had sustained a thorough wetting; and I
without my waggoner&rsquo;s slop, of which, it being in the same
plight, I had also divested myself.</p>
<p>The new comer was a well-made fellow of about thirty, with an
open and agreeable countenance.&nbsp; I found him very well
informed for a man in his station, and with some pretensions to
humour.&nbsp; After we had discoursed for some time on
indifferent subjects, the postillion, who had exhausted his pipe,
took it from his mouth, and, knocking out the ashes upon the
ground, exclaimed, &ldquo;I little thought, when I got up in the
morning, that I should spend the night in such agreeable company,
and after such a fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am glad that your opinion
of us has improved; it is not long since you seemed to hold us in
rather a suspicious light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;seeing the
place you were taking me to!&nbsp; I was not a little, but very
much afraid of ye both; and so I continued for some time, though,
not to show a craven heart, I pretended to be quite satisfied;
but I see I was altogether mistaken about ye.&nbsp; I thought you
vagrant Gypsy folks and trampers; but now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vagrant Gypsy folks and trampers,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;and what are we but people of that stamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;if you wish to
be thought such, I am far too civil a person to contradict you,
especially after your kindness to me, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what do you mean by
but?&nbsp; I would have you to know that I am proud of <!-- page
390--><a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
390</span>being a travelling blacksmith; look at these
donkey-shoes; I finished them this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postillion took the shoes and examined them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So you made these shoes?&rdquo; he cried at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I did; do you doubt it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I thought I should bring
you back to your original opinion.&nbsp; I am, then, a vagrant
Gypsy body, a tramper, a wandering blacksmith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a blacksmith, whatever else you may be,&rdquo; said
the postillion, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you account for my making those
shoes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your not being a blacksmith,&rdquo; said the
postillion; &ldquo;no blacksmith would have made shoes in that
manner.&nbsp; Besides, what did you mean just now by saying you
had finished these shoes to-day?&nbsp; A real blacksmith would
have flung off three or four sets of donkey-shoes in one morning,
but you, I will be sworn, have been hammering at these for days,
and they do you credit&mdash;but why?&mdash;because you are no
blacksmith; no, friend, your shoes may do for this young
gentlewoman&rsquo;s animal, but I shouldn&rsquo;t like to have my
horses shod by you, unless at a great pinch indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for what do you take
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for some runaway young gentleman,&rdquo; said the
postillion.&nbsp; &ldquo;No offence, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all; no one is offended at being taken or
mistaken for a young gentleman, whether runaway or not; but from
whence do you suppose I have run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 391--><a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>&ldquo;Why, from college,&rdquo; said the man:
&ldquo;no offence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever; and what induced me to run away from
college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A love affair, I&rsquo;ll be sworn,&rdquo; said the
postillion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had become acquainted with this
young gentlewoman, so she and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind how you get on, friend,&rdquo; said Belle, in a
deep serious tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray proceed,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I dare say you mean
no offence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None in the world,&rdquo; said the postillion;
&ldquo;all I was going to say was, that you agreed to run away
together, you from college, and she from boarding-school.&nbsp;
Well, there&rsquo;s nothing to be ashamed of in a matter like
that, such things are done every day by young folks in high
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you offended?&rdquo; said I to Belle.</p>
<p>Belle made no answer; but, placing her elbows on her knees,
buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we ran away together?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;to Gretna
Green, though I can&rsquo;t say that I drove ye, though I have
driven many a pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from Gretna Green we came here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound you did,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;till you could arrange matters at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the horse-shoes?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The donkey-shoes you mean,&rdquo; answered the
postillion; &ldquo;why, I suppose you persuaded the blacksmith
who married you to give you, before you left, a few lessons in
his trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we intend to stay here till we have arranged
matters at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;till the old
<!-- page 392--><a name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
392</span>people are pacified, and they send you letters directed
to the next post town, to be left till called for, beginning with
&lsquo;Dear children,&rsquo; and enclosing you each a cheque for
one hundred pounds, when you will leave this place, and go home
in a coach like gentlefolks, to visit your governors; I should
like nothing better than to have the driving of you: and then
there will be a grand meeting of the two families, and after a
few reproaches, the old people will agree to do something
handsome for the poor thoughtless things; so you will have a
genteel house taken for you, and an annuity allowed you.&nbsp;
You won&rsquo;t get much the first year, five hundred at the
most, in order that the old folks may let you feel that they are
not altogether satisfied with you, and that you are yet entirely
in their power; but the second, if you don&rsquo;t get a cool
thousand, may I catch cold, especially should young madam here
present a son and heir for the old people to fondle, destined one
day to become sole heir of the two illustrious houses; and then
all the grand folks in the neighbourhood, who have&mdash;bless
their prudent hearts!&mdash;kept rather aloof from you till then,
for fear you should want anything from them&mdash;I say all the
carriage people in the neighbourhood, when they see how
swimmingly matters are going on, will come in shoals to visit
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are getting on
swimmingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I was not a
gentleman&rsquo;s servant nine years without learning the ways of
gentry, and being able to know gentry when I see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you say to all this?&rdquo; I demanded of
Belle.</p>
<p><!-- page 393--><a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>&ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; interposed the postillion,
&ldquo;I have one more word to say:&mdash;and when you are
surrounded by your comforts, keeping your nice little barouche
and pair, your coachman and livery servant, and visited by all
the carriage people in the neighbourhood&mdash;to say nothing of
the time when you come to the family estates on the death of the
old people&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if now and then you
look back with longing and regret to the days when you lived in
the damp dripping dingle, had no better equipage than a pony or
donkey cart, and saw no better company than a tramper or Gypsy,
except once, when a poor postillion was glad to seat himself at
your charcoal fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;did you ever take lessons
in elocution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not directly,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;but my
old master, who was in Parliament, did, and so did his son, who
was intended to be an orator.&nbsp; A great professor used to
come and give them lessons, and I used to stand and listen, by
which means I picked up a considerable quantity of what is called
rhetoric.&nbsp; In what I last said, I was aiming at what I have
heard him frequently endeavouring to teach my governors as a
thing indispensably necessary in all oratory, a graceful
pere&mdash;pere&mdash;peregrination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peroration, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;and now
I&rsquo;m sure I am not mistaken about you; you have taken
lessons yourself, at first hand, in the college vacations, and a
promising pupil you were, I make no doubt.&nbsp; Well, your
friends will be all the happier to get you back.&nbsp; Has your
governor much borough interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 394--><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>&ldquo;I ask you once more,&rdquo; said I, addressing
myself to Belle, &ldquo;what you think of the history which this
good man has made for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What should I think of it,&rdquo; said Belle, still
keeping her face buried in her hands, &ldquo;but that it is mere
nonsense?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said the postillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and you know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May my leg always ache, if I do,&rdquo; said the
postillion, patting his leg with his hand; &ldquo;will you
persuade me that this young man has never been at
college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been at college, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to the best schools in Britain, to say
nothing of a celebrated one in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it comes to the same thing,&rdquo; said the
postillion, &ldquo;or perhaps you know more than if you had been
at college&mdash;and your governor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My governor, as you call him,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And his borough interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father had no borough interest,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;had he possessed any, he would perhaps not have died, as
he did, honourably poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;if he had
had borough interest, he wouldn&rsquo;t have been poor, nor
honourable, though perhaps a right honourable.&nbsp; However,
with your grand education and genteel manners, you made all right
at last by persuading this noble young gentlewoman to run away
from boarding-school with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never at boarding-school,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;unless you call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 395--><a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
395</span>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion,
&ldquo;boarding-school is vulgar, I know: I beg your pardon, I
ought to have called it academy, or by some other much finer
name&mdash;you were in something much greater than a
boarding-school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are right,&rdquo; said Belle, lifting up her
head and looking the postillion full in the face by the light of
the charcoal fire, &ldquo;for I was bred in the
workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wooh!&rdquo; said the postillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true that I am of good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;let us
hear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of good blood,&rdquo; continued Belle; &ldquo;my name
is Berners, Isopel Berners, though my parents were
unfortunate.&nbsp; Indeed, with respect to blood, I believe I am
of better blood than the young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;by my
father&rsquo;s side I am of Cornish blood, and by my
mother&rsquo;s of brave French Protestant extraction.&nbsp; Now,
with respect to the blood of my father&mdash;and to be descended
well on the father&rsquo;s side is the principal thing&mdash;it
is the best blood in the world, for the Cornish blood, as the
proverb says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the proverb says,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;I say my blood is the best&mdash;my name is
Berners, Isopel Berners&mdash;it was my mother&rsquo;s name, and
is better, I am sure, than any you bear, what ever that may be;
and though you say that the descent on the father&rsquo;s side is
the principal thing&mdash;and I know why you say so,&rdquo; she
added with some excitement&mdash;&ldquo;I say that descent on the
mother&rsquo;s side is of most account, because the
mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 396--><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>&ldquo;Just come from Gretna Green, and already
quarrelling!&rdquo; said the postillion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not come from Gretna Green,&rdquo; said
Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I had forgot,&rdquo; said the postillion,
&ldquo;none but great people go to Gretna Green.&nbsp; Well,
then, from church, and already quarrelling about family, just
like two great people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have never been to church,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;and to prevent any more guessing on your part, it will be
as well for me to tell you, friend, that I am nothing to the
young man, and he, of course, nothing to me.&nbsp; I am a poor
travelling girl, born in a workhouse: journeying on my occasions
with certain companions, I came to this hollow, where my company
quarrelled with the young man, who had settled down here, as he
had a right to do if he pleased; and not being able to drive him
out, they went away after quarrelling with me too, for not
choosing to side with them; so I stayed here along with the young
man, there being room for us both, and the place being as free to
me as to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in order that you may be no longer puzzled with
respect to myself,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will give you a brief
outline of my history.&nbsp; I am the son of honourable parents,
who gave me a first-rate education, as far as literature and
languages went, with which education I endeavoured, on the death
of my father, to advance myself to wealth and reputation in the
Big City; but failing in the attempt, I conceived a disgust for
the busy world, and determined to retire from it.&nbsp; After
wandering about for some time, and meeting with various
adventures, in one of which I contrived to obtain a pony, cart,
and certain tools, used by smiths and <!-- page 397--><a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>tinkers, I
came to this place, where I amused myself with making
horse-shoes, or rather pony-shoes, having acquired the art of
wielding the hammer and tongs from a strange kind of
smith&mdash;not him of Gretna Green&mdash;whom I knew in my
childhood.&nbsp; And here I lived, doing harm to no one, quite
lonely and solitary, till one fine morning the premises were
visited by this young gentlewoman and her companions.&nbsp; She
did herself anything but justice when she said that her
companions quarrelled with her because she would not side with
them against me; they quarrelled with her because she came most
heroically to my assistance as I was on the point of being
murdered; and she forgot to tell you that, after they had
abandoned her, she stood by me in the dark hour, comforting and
cheering me, when unspeakable dread, to which I am occasionally
subject, took possession of my mind.&nbsp; She says she is
nothing to me, even as I am nothing to her.&nbsp; I am of course
nothing to her, but she is mistaken in thinking she is nothing to
me.&nbsp; I entertain the highest regard and admiration for her,
being convinced that I might search the whole world in vain for a
nature more heroic and devoted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for my part,&rdquo; said Belle, with a sob,
&ldquo;a more quiet agreeable partner in a place like this I
would not wish to have; it is true he has strange ways and
frequently puts words into my mouth very difficult to utter,
but&mdash;but . . . &rdquo; and here she buried her face once
more in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I have been
mistaken about you; that is, not altogether, but in part.&nbsp;
You are not rich folks, it seems, but you are not common people,
and that I could have sworn.&nbsp; <!-- page 398--><a
name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 398</span>What I call
a shame is, that some people I have known are not in your place
and you in theirs, you with their estates and borough interest,
they in this dingle with these carts and animals; but there is no
help for these things.&nbsp; Were I the great Mumbo Jumbo above,
I would endeavour to manage matters better; but being a simple
postillion, glad to earn three shillings a day, I can&rsquo;t be
expected to do much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Mumbo Jumbo?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I see there may
be a thing or two I know better than yourself.&nbsp; Mumbo Jumbo
is a god of the black coast, to which people go for ivory and
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you ever there?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;but I heard
plenty of Mumbo Jumbo when I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell us something about
yourself.&nbsp; I believe that your own real history would prove
quite as entertaining, if not more, than that which you imagined
about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rather tired,&rdquo; said the postillion,
&ldquo;and my leg is rather troublesome.&nbsp; I should be glad
to try to sleep upon one of your blankets.&nbsp; However, as you
wish to hear something about me, I shall be happy to oblige you;
but your fire is rather low, and this place is chilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I arose, and put fresh charcoal on the pan; then
taking it outside the tent, with a kind of fan which I had
fashioned, I fanned the coals into a red glow, and continued
doing so until the greater part of the noxious gas, which the
coals are in the habit of exhaling, was exhausted.&nbsp; I then
brought it into the tent and reseated myself, scattering over the
coals a small portion of sugar.&nbsp; &ldquo;No <!-- page
399--><a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>bad smell,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;but upon
the whole I think I like the smell of tobacco better; and with
your permission I will once more light my pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he relighted his pipe; and, after taking two or
three whiffs, began in the following manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a poor postillion, as you see; yet, as I have seen
a thing or two, and heard a thing or two of what is going on in
the world, perhaps what I have to tell you connected with myself
may not prove altogether uninteresting.&nbsp; Now, my friends,
this manner of opening a story is what the man who taught
rhetoric would call a hex&mdash;hex&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exordium,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said the postillion; &ldquo;I treated
you to a per&mdash;per&mdash;peroration some time ago, so that I
have contrived to put the cart before the horse, as the Irish
orators frequently do in the honourable House, in whose speeches,
especially those who have taken lessons in rhetoric, the
per&mdash;per&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&mdash;frequently goes
before the exordium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born in the neighbouring county; my <!-- page
401--><a name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
401</span>father was land-steward to a squire of about a thousand
a year.&nbsp; My father had two sons, of whom I am the youngest
by some years.&nbsp; My elder brother was of a spirited, roving
disposition, and for fear that he should turn out what is
generally termed ungain, my father determined to send him to sea:
so once upon a time, when my brother was about fifteen, he took
him to the great sea-port of the county, where he apprenticed him
to a captain of one of the ships which trade to the high Barbary
coast.&nbsp; Fine ships they were, I have heard say, more than
thirty in number, and all belonging to a wonderful great
gentleman, who had once been a parish boy, but had contrived to
make an immense fortune by trading to that coast for gold-dust,
ivory, and other strange articles; and for doing so, I mean for
making a fortune, had been made a knight baronet.&nbsp; So my
brother went to the high Barbary shore, on board the fine vessel,
and in about a year returned and came to visit us; he repeated
the voyage several times, always coming to see his parents on his
return.&nbsp; Strange stories he used to tell us of what he had
been witness to on the high Barbary coast, both off shore and
on.&nbsp; He said that the fine vessel in which he sailed was
nothing better than a painted hell; that the captain was a
veritable fiend, whose grand delight was in tormenting his men,
especially when they were sick, as they frequently were, there
being always fever on the high Barbary coast; and that though the
captain was occasionally sick himself, his being so made no
difference, or rather it did make a difference, though for the
worse, he being when sick always more inveterate and malignant
than at other times.&nbsp; He said that once, when he himself
<!-- page 402--><a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
402</span>was sick, his captain had pitched his face all over,
which exploit was much applauded by the other high Barbary
captains&mdash;all of whom, from what my brother said, appeared
to be of much the same disposition as my brother&rsquo;s captain,
taking wonderful delight in tormenting the crews, and doing all
manner of terrible things.&nbsp; My brother frequently said that
nothing whatever prevented him from running away from his ship,
and never returning, but the hope he entertained of one day being
captain himself, and able to torment people in his turn, which he
solemnly vowed he would do, as a kind of compensation for what he
himself had undergone.&nbsp; And if things were going on in a
strange way off the high Barbary shore amongst those who came
there to trade, they were going on in a way yet stranger with the
people who lived upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the strange ways of the black men who lived on that
shore, of which my brother used to tell us at home!&mdash;selling
their sons, daughters, and servants for slaves, and the prisoners
taken in battle, to the Spanish captains, to be carried to
Havannah, and when there, sold at a profit, the idea of which, my
brother said, went to the hearts of our own captains, who used to
say what a hard thing it was that free-born Englishmen could not
have a hand in the traffic, seeing that it was forbidden by the
laws of their country; talking fondly of the good old times when
their forefathers used to carry slaves to Jamaica and Barbadoes,
realising immense profit, besides the pleasure of hearing their
shrieks on the voyage; and then the superstitions of the blacks,
which my brother used to talk of; their sharks&rsquo; teeth,
their wisps of fowls&rsquo; feathers, their <!-- page 403--><a
name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>half-baked
pots full of burnt bones, of which they used to make what they
called fetish, and bow down to, and ask favours of, and then,
perhaps, abuse and strike, provided the senseless rubbish did not
give them what they asked for; and then, above all, Mumbo Jumbo,
the grand fetish master, who lived somewhere in the woods, and
who used to come out every now and then with his fetish
companions; a monstrous figure, all wound round with leaves and
branches, so as to be quite indistinguishable, and, seating
himself on the high seat in the villages, receive homage from the
people, and also gifts and offerings, the most valuable of which
were pretty damsels, and then betake himself back again, with his
followers, into the woods.&nbsp; Oh, the tales that my brother
used to tell us of the high Barbary shore!&nbsp; Poor fellow!
what became of him I can&rsquo;t say; the last time he came back
from a voyage, he told us that his captain, as soon as he had
brought his vessel to port and settled with his owner, drowned
himself off the quay, in a fit of the horrors, which it seems
high Barbary captains, after a certain number of years, are much
subject to.&nbsp; After staying about a month with us, he went to
sea again, with another captain; and, bad as the old one had
been, it appears the new one was worse, for, unable to bear his
treatment, my brother left his ship off the high Barbary shore,
and ran away up the country.&nbsp; Some of his comrades, whom we
afterwards saw, said that there were various reports about him on
the shore; one that he had taken on with Mumbo Jumbo, and was
serving him in his house in the woods, in the capacity of
swashbuckler, or life-guardsman; another, that he was gone in
quest of <!-- page 404--><a name="page404"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 404</span>a mighty city in the heart of the
negro country; another, that in swimming a stream he had been
devoured by an alligator.&nbsp; Now, these two last reports were
bad enough; the idea of their flesh and blood being bit asunder
by a ravenous fish, was sad enough to my poor parents; and not
very comfortable was the thought of his sweltering over the hot
sands in quest of the negro city; but the idea of their son,
their eldest child, serving Mumbo Jumbo as swashbuckler, was
worst of all, and caused my poor parents to shed many a scalding
tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed at home with my parents until I was about
eighteen, assisting my father in various ways.&nbsp; I then went
to live at the squire&rsquo;s, partly as groom, partly as
footman.&nbsp; After living in the country some time, I attended
the family in a trip of six weeks, which they made to
London.&nbsp; Whilst there, happening to have some words with an
old ill-tempered coachman, who had been for a great many years in
the family, my master advised me to leave, offering to recommend
me to a family of his acquaintance who were in need of a
footman.&nbsp; I was glad to accept his offer, and in a few days
went to my new place.&nbsp; My new master was one of the great
gentry, a baronet in Parliament, and possessed of an estate of
about twenty thousand a year; his family consisted of his lady, a
son, a fine young man, just coming of age, and two very sweet
amiable daughters.&nbsp; I liked this place much better than my
first, there was so much more pleasant noise and bustle&mdash;so
much more grand company, and so many more opportunities of
improving myself.&nbsp; Oh, how I liked to see the grand coaches
drive up to the door, with the grand company! and though, <!--
page 405--><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
405</span>amidst that company, there were some who did not look
very grand, there were others, and not a few, who did.&nbsp; Some
of the ladies quite captivated me; there was the Marchioness of
in particular.&nbsp; This young lady puts me much in mind of her;
it is true, the Marchioness, as I saw her then, was about fifteen
years older than this young gentlewoman is now, and not so tall
by some inches, but she had the very same hair, and much the same
neck and shoulders&mdash;no offence, I hope?&nbsp; And then some
of the young gentlemen, with their cool, haughty,
care-for-nothing looks, struck me as being very fine
fellows.&nbsp; There was one in particular, whom I frequently
used to stare at, not altogether unlike some one I have seen
hereabouts&mdash;he had a slight cast in his eye, and . . . but I
won&rsquo;t enter into every particular.&nbsp; And then the
footmen!&nbsp; Oh, how those footmen helped to improve me with
their conversation!&nbsp; Many of them could converse much more
glibly than their masters, and appeared to have much better
taste.&nbsp; At any rate, they seldom approved of what their
masters did.&nbsp; I remember being once with one in the gallery
of the play-house, when something of Shakespeare&rsquo;s was
being performed: some one in the first tier of boxes was
applauding very loudly.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s my fool of a
governor,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;he is weak enough to like
Shakespeare&mdash;I don&rsquo;t;&mdash;he&rsquo;s so confoundedly
low, but he won&rsquo;t last long&mdash;going down.&nbsp;
Shakespeare culminated&mdash;I think that was the
word&mdash;culminated some time ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then the professor of elocution, of whom my
governors used to take lessons, and of which lessons I had my
share, by listening behind the door; but for that professor of
elocution I should <!-- page 406--><a name="page406"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 406</span>not be able to round my
periods&mdash;an expression of his&mdash;in the manner I do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I had been three years at this place, my mistress
died.&nbsp; Her death, however, made no great alteration in my
way of living, the family spending their winters in London, and
their summers at their old seat in S--- as before.&nbsp; At last,
the young ladies, who had not yet got husbands, which was strange
enough, seeing, as I told you before, they were very amiable,
proposed to our governor a travelling expedition abroad.&nbsp;
The old baronet consented, though young master was much against
it, saying they would all be much better at home.&nbsp; As the
girls persisted, however, he at last withdrew his opposition, and
even promised to follow them as soon as his parliamentary duties
would permit; for he was just got into Parliament, and, like most
other young members, thought that nothing could be done in the
House without him.&nbsp; So the old gentleman and the two young
ladies set off, taking me with them, and a couple of
ladies&rsquo; maids to wait upon them.&nbsp; First of all, we
went to Paris, where we continued three months, the old baronet
and the ladies going to see the various sights of the city and
the neighbourhood, and I attending them.&nbsp; They soon got
tired of sightseeing, and of Paris too; and so did I.&nbsp;
However, they still continued there, in order, I believe, that
the young ladies might lay in a store of French finery.&nbsp; I
should have passed my idle time at Paris, of which I had plenty
after the sight-seeing was over, very unpleasantly, but for Black
Jack.&nbsp; Eh! did you never hear of Black Jack?&nbsp; Ah! if
you had ever been an English servant in Paris, you would have
known Black Jack; not an English <!-- page 407--><a
name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
407</span>gentleman&rsquo;s servant who has been at Paris for
this last ten years but knows Black Jack and his ordinary.&nbsp;
A strange fellow he was&mdash;of what country no one could
exactly say&mdash;for as for judging from speech, that was
impossible, Jack speaking all languages equally ill.&nbsp; Some
said he came direct from Satan&rsquo;s kitchen, and that when he
gives up keeping ordinary, he will return there again, though the
generally-received opinion at Paris was, that he was at one time
butler to King Pharaoh; and that, after lying asleep for four
thousand years in a place called the Kattycombs, he was awaked by
the sound of Nelson&rsquo;s cannon at the battle of the Nile, and
going to the shore, took on with the admiral, and became, in
course of time, ship steward; and that after Nelson&rsquo;s death
he was captured by the French, on board one of whose vessels he
served in a somewhat similar capacity till the peace, when he
came to Paris, and set up an ordinary for servants, sticking the
name of Katcomb over the door, in allusion to the place where he
had his long sleep.&nbsp; But, whatever his origin was, Jack kept
his own counsel, and appeared to care nothing for what people
said about him, or called him.&nbsp; Yes, I forgot, there was one
name he would not be called, and that was
&lsquo;Portuguese.&rsquo;&nbsp; I once saw Black Jack knock down
a coachman, six foot high, who called him black-faced
Portuguese.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any name but dat, you shab,&rsquo; said
Black Jack, who was a little round fellow, of about five feet
two; &lsquo;I would not stand to be called Portuguese by Nelson
himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jack was rather fond of talking about
Nelson, and hearing people talk about him, so that it is not
improbable that he may have sailed with him; and with respect to
his <!-- page 408--><a name="page408"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 408</span>having been King Pharaoh&rsquo;s
butler, all I have to say is, I am not disposed to give the
downright lie to the report.&nbsp; Jack was always ready to do a
kind turn to a poor servant out of place, and has often been
known to assist such as were in prison, which charitable
disposition he perhaps acquired from having lost a good place
himself, having seen the inside of a prison, and known the want
of a meal&rsquo;s victuals, all which trials King Pharaoh&rsquo;s
butler underwent, so he may have been that butler; at any rate, I
have known positive conclusions come to on no better premises, if
indeed as good.&nbsp; As for the story of his coming direct from
Satan&rsquo;s kitchen, I place no confidence in it at all, as
Black Jack had nothing of Satan about him but blackness, on which
account he was called Black Jack.&nbsp; Nor am I disposed to give
credit to a report that his hatred of the Portuguese arose from
some ill treatment which he had once experienced when on shore,
at Lisbon, from certain gentlewomen of the place, but rather
conclude that it arose from an opinion he entertained that the
Portuguese never paid their debts, one of the ambassadors of that
nation, whose house he had served, having left Paris several
thousand francs in his debt.&nbsp; This is all that I have to say
about Black Jack, without whose funny jokes, and good ordinary, I
should have passed my time in Paris in a very disconsolate
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we had been at Paris between two and three
months, we left it in the direction of Italy, which country the
family had a great desire to see.&nbsp; After travelling a great
many days in a thing which, though called a diligence, did not
exhibit much diligence, we came to a great big town, seated <!--
page 409--><a name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
409</span>around a nasty salt-water bason, connected by a narrow
passage with the sea.&nbsp; Here we were to embark; and so we did
as soon as possible, glad enough to get away&mdash;at least I
was, and so I make no doubt were the rest, for such a place for
bad smells I never was in.&nbsp; It seems all the drains and
sewers of the place run into that same salt bason, voiding into
it all their impurities, which, not being able to escape into the
sea in any considerable quantity, owing to the narrowness of the
entrance, there accumulate, filling the whole atmosphere with
these same outrageous scents, on which account the town is a
famous lodging-house of the plague.&nbsp; The ship in which we
embarked was bound for a place in Italy called Naples, where we
were to stay some time.&nbsp; The voyage was rather a lazy one,
the ship not being moved by steam; for at the time of which I am
speaking, some five years ago, steam-ships were not so plentiful
as now.&nbsp; There were only two passengers in the grand cabin,
where my governor and his daughters were, an Italian lady and a
priest.&nbsp; Of the lady I have not much to say; she appeared to
be a quiet, respectable person enough, and after our arrival at
Naples I neither saw nor heard anything more of her; but of the
priest I shall have a good deal to say in the sequel (that, by
the bye, is a word I learnt from the professor of rhetoric), and
it would have been well for our family had they never met
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the third day of the voyage the priest came to me,
who was rather unwell with seasickness, which he, of course, felt
nothing of&mdash;that kind of people being never affected like
others.&nbsp; He was a finish-looking man of about forty-five,
but had something strange in his eyes, which I <!-- page 410--><a
name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>have since
thought denoted that all was not right in a certain place called
the heart.&nbsp; After a few words of condolence, in a broken
kind of English, he asked me various questions about our family;
and I, won by his seeming kindness, told him all I knew about
them&mdash;of which communicativeness I afterwards very much
repented.&nbsp; As soon as he had got out of me all he desired,
he left me; and I observed that during the rest of the voyage he
was wonderfully attentive to our governor, and yet more to the
young ladies.&nbsp; Both, however, kept him rather at a distance;
the young ladies were reserved, and once or twice I heard our
governor cursing him between his teeth for a sharking
priest.&nbsp; The priest, however, was not disconcerted, and
continued his attentions, which in a little time produced an
effect, so that, by the time we landed at Naples, our great folks
had conceived a kind of liking for the man, and when they took
their leave invited him to visit them, which he promised to
do.&nbsp; We hired a grand house or palace at Naples; it belonged
to a poor kind of prince, who was glad enough to let it to our
governor, and also his servants and carriages; and glad enough
were the poor servants, for they got from us what they never got
from the prince&mdash;plenty of meat and money; and glad enough,
I make no doubt, were the horses for the provender we gave them;
and I dare say the coaches were not sorry to be cleaned and
furbished up.&nbsp; Well, we went out and came in; going to see
the sights, and returning.&nbsp; Amongst other things we saw was
the burning mountain, and the tomb of a certain sorcerer called
Virgilio, who made witch rhymes, by which he could raise the
dead.&nbsp; Plenty of people came to see us, both English and
<!-- page 411--><a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
411</span>Italians, and amongst the rest the priest.&nbsp; He did
not come amongst the first, but allowed us to settle and become a
little quiet before he showed himself; and after a day or two he
paid us another visit, then another, till at last his visits were
daily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not like that Jack Priest; so I kept my eye upon
all his motions.&nbsp; Lord! how that Jack Priest did curry
favour with our governor and the two young ladies; and he
curried, and curried, till he had got himself into favour with
the governor, and more especially with the two young ladies, of
whom their father was doatingly fond.&nbsp; At last the ladies
took lessons in Italian of the priest, a language in which he was
said to be a grand proficient, and of which they had hitherto
known but very little; and from that time his influence over
them, and consequently over the old governor, increased, till the
tables were turned, and he no longer curried favour with them,
but they with him&mdash;yes, as true as my leg aches, the young
ladies curried, and the old governor curried favour with that
same priest; when he was with them, they seemed almost to hang on
his lips, that is, the young ladies; and as for the old governor,
he never contradicted him, and when the fellow was absent, which,
by the bye, was not often, it was, &lsquo;Father so-and-so said
this, and Father so-and-so said that; Father so-and-so thinks we
should do so-and-so, or that we should not do
so-and-so.&rsquo;&nbsp; I at first thought that he must have
given them something, some philtre or the like; but one of the
English maid-servants, who had a kind of respect for me, and who
saw much more behind the scenes than I did, informed me that he
was continually instilling strange notions into their heads,
striving, by every possible method, <!-- page 412--><a
name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 412</span>to make
them despise the religion of their own land, and take up that of
the foreign country in which they were.&nbsp; And sure enough, in
a little time, the girls had altogether left off going to an
English chapel, and were continually visiting places of Italian
worship.&nbsp; The old governor, it is true, still went to his
church, but he appeared to be hesitating between two opinions;
and once, when he was at dinner, he said to two or three English
friends, that since he had become better acquainted with it, he
had conceived a much more favourable opinion of the Catholic
religion than he had previously entertained.&nbsp; In a word, the
priest ruled the house, and everything was done according to his
will and pleasure; by degrees he persuaded the young ladies to
drop their English acquaintances, whose place he supplied with
Italians, chiefly females.&nbsp; My poor old governor would not
have had a person to speak to&mdash;for he never could learn the
language&mdash;but for two or three Englishmen who used to come
occasionally and take a bottle with him in a summer-house, whose
company he could not be persuaded to resign, notwithstanding the
entreaties of his daughters, instigated by the priest, whose
grand endeavour seemed to be to render the minds of all three
foolish, for his own ends.&nbsp; And if he was busy above stairs
with the governor, there was another busy below with us poor
English servants, a kind of subordinate priest, a low Italian; as
he could speak no language but his own, he was continually
jabbering to us in that, and by hearing him the maids and myself
contrived to pick up a good deal of the language, so that we
understood most that was said, and could speak it very fairly;
and the themes of his jabber were the <!-- page 413--><a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>beauty and
virtues of one whom he called Holy Mary, and the power and
grandeur of one whom he called the Holy Father; and he told us
that we should shortly have an opportunity of seeing the Holy
Father, who could do anything he liked with Holy Mary: in the
meantime we had plenty of opportunities of seeing Holy Mary, for
in every church, chapel, and convent to which we were taken,
there was an image of Holy Mary, who, if the images were dressed
at all in her fashion, must have been very fond of short
petticoats and tinsel, and who, if those said figures at all
resembled her in face, could scarcely have been half as handsome
as either of my two fellow-servants, not to speak of the young
ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it happened that one of the female servants was
much taken with what she saw and heard, and gave herself up
entirely to the will of the subordinate, who had quite as much
dominion over her as his superior had over the ladies; the other
maid, however, the one who had a kind of respect for me, was not
so easily besotted; she used to laugh at what she saw, and at
what the fellow told her, and from her I learnt that amongst
other things intended by these priestly confederates was robbery;
she said that the poor old governor had already been persuaded by
his daughters to put more than a thousand pounds into the
superior priest&rsquo;s hands for purposes of charity and
religion, as was said, and that the subordinate one had already
inveigled her fellow-servant out of every penny which she had
saved from her wages, and had endeavoured likewise to obtain what
money she herself had, but in vain.&nbsp; With respect to myself,
the fellow shortly after made an attempt towards <!-- page
414--><a name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
414</span>obtaining a hundred crowns, of which, by some means, he
knew me to be in possession, telling me what a meritorious thing
it was to give one&rsquo;s superfluities for the purposes of
religion.&nbsp; &lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and
if, after my return to my native country, I find I have anything
which I don&rsquo;t want myself, I will employ it in helping to
build a Methodist chapel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time that the three months were expired for
which we had hired the palace of the needy Prince, the old
governor began to talk of returning to England, at least of
leaving Italy.&nbsp; I believe he had become frightened at the
calls which were continually being made upon him for money; for
after all, you know, if there is a sensitive part of a
man&rsquo;s wearing apparel, it is his breeches pocket; but the
young ladies could not think of leaving dear Italy and the dear
priest; and then they had seen nothing of the country, they had
only seen Naples; before leaving dear Italia they must see more
of the country and the cities; above all, they must see a place
which they called the Eternal City, or some similar nonsensical
name; and they persisted so that the poor governor permitted
them, as usual, to have their way; and it was decided what route
they should take&mdash;that is, the priest was kind enough to
decide for them, and was also kind enough to promise to go with
them part of the route, as far as a place where there was a
wonderful figure of Holy Mary, which the priest said it was
highly necessary for them to see before visiting the Eternal
City: so we left Naples in hired carriages, driven by fellows
they call veturini, cheating drunken dogs I remember they
were.&nbsp; Besides our own family <!-- page 415--><a
name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 415</span>there was
the priest and his subordinate, and a couple of hired
lackeys.&nbsp; We were several days upon the journey, travelling
through a very wild country, which the ladies pretended to be
delighted with, and which the governor cursed on account of the
badness of the roads; and when we came to any particularly wild
spot we used to stop, in order to enjoy the scenery, as the
ladies said; and then we would spread a horse-cloth on the
ground, and eat bread and cheese, and drink wine of the
country.&nbsp; And some of the holes and corners in which we
bivouacked, as the ladies called it, were something like this
place where we are now, so that when I came down here it put me
in mind of them.&nbsp; At last we arrived at the place where was
the holy image.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went to the house or chapel in which the holy image
was kept&mdash;a frightful ugly black figure of Holy Mary,
dressed in her usual way; and after we had stared at the figure,
and some of our party had bowed down to it, we were shown a great
many things which were called holy relics, which consisted of
thumb-nails, and fore-nails, and toe-nails, and hair and teeth,
and a feather or two, and a mighty thigh-bone, but whether of a
man or a camel, I can&rsquo;t say; all of which things, I was
told, if properly touched and handled, had mighty power to cure
all kinds of disorders.&nbsp; And as we went from the holy house,
we saw a man in a state of great excitement: he was foaming at
the mouth, and cursing the holy image and all its household,
because, after he had worshipped it and made offerings to it, and
besought it to assist him in a game of chance which he was about
to play, it had left him in the lurch, allowing him to lose all
his <!-- page 416--><a name="page416"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 416</span>money.&nbsp; And when I thought of
all the rubbish I had seen, and the purposes which it was applied
to, in conjunction with the rage of the losing gamester at the
deaf and dumb image, I could not help comparing the whole with
what my poor brother used to tell me of the superstitious
practices of the blacks on the high Barbary shore, and their
occasional rage and fury at the things they worshipped; and I
said to myself, if all this here doesn&rsquo;t smell of fetish
may I smell fetid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this place the priest left us, returning to Naples
with his subordinate, on some particular business I
suppose.&nbsp; It was, however, agreed that he should visit us at
the Holy City.&nbsp; We did not go direct to the Holy City, but
bent our course to two or three other cities which the family
were desirous of seeing; but as nothing occurred to us in these
places of any particular interest, I shall take the liberty of
passing them by in silence.&nbsp; At length we arrived at the
Eternal City: an immense city it was, looking as if it had stood
for a long time, and would stand for a long time still; compared
with it, London would look like a mere assemblage of bee-skeps;
however, give me the bee-skeps with their merry hum and bustle,
and life and honey, rather than that huge town, which looked like
a sepulchre, where there was no life, no busy hum, no bees, but a
scanty sallow population, intermixed with black priests, white
priests, grey priests; and though I don&rsquo;t say there was no
honey in the place, for I believe there was, I am ready to take
my Bible oath that it was not made there, and that the priests
kept it all for themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day after our arrival,&rdquo; continued the
postillion, &ldquo;I was sent, under the guidance of a lackey of
the place, with a letter, which the priest, when he left, had
given us for a friend of his in the Eternal City.&nbsp; We went
to a large house, and on ringing were admitted by a porter into a
cloister, where I saw some ill-looking, shabby young fellows
walking about, who spoke English to one another.&nbsp; To one of
these the porter delivered the letter, and the young fellow going
away, presently returned and told me to follow him; he led me
into a large room, where, behind a table, on which were various
papers, and a thing which they call, in that country, a crucifix,
sat a man in a kind of priestly dress.&nbsp; The lad having
opened the door for me, shut it behind me, and went away.&nbsp;
The man behind the table was so engaged in reading the letter
which I had brought, that at first he took no notice of me; <!--
page 418--><a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
418</span>he had red hair, a kind of half-English countenance,
and was seemingly about five-and-thirty.&nbsp; After a little
time he laid the letter down, appeared to consider a moment, and
then opened his mouth with a strange laugh, not a loud laugh, for
I heard nothing but a kind of hissing deep down the throat; all
of a sudden, however, perceiving me, he gave a slight start, but
instantly recovering himself, he inquired in English concerning
the health of the family, and where we lived: on my delivering
him a card, he bade me inform my master and the ladies that in
the course of the day he would do himself the honour of waiting
upon them.&nbsp; He then arose and opened the door for me to
depart.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man was perfectly civil and courteous,
but I did not like that strange laugh of his, after having read
the letter.&nbsp; He was as good as his word, and that same day
paid us a visit.&nbsp; It was now arranged that we should pass
the winter in Rome&mdash;to my great annoyance, for I wished to
return to my native land, being heartily tired of everything
connected with Italy.&nbsp; I was not, however, without hope that
our young master would shortly arrive, when I trusted that
matters, as far as the family were concerned, would be put on a
better footing.&nbsp; In a few days our new acquaintance, who, it
seems, was a mongrel Englishman, had procured a house for our
accommodation; it was large enough, but not near so pleasant as
that we had at Naples, which was light and airy, with a large
garden.&nbsp; This was a dark, gloomy structure in a narrow
street, with a frowning church beside it; it was not far from the
place where our new friend lived, and its being so was probably
the reason why he <!-- page 419--><a name="page419"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 419</span>selected it.&nbsp; It was furnished
partly with articles which we bought, and partly with those which
we hired.&nbsp; We lived something in the same way as at Naples;
but though I did not much like Naples, I yet liked it better than
this place, which was so gloomy.&nbsp; Our new acquaintance made
himself as agreeable as he could, conducting the ladies to
churches and convents, and frequently passing the afternoon
drinking with the governor, who was fond of a glass of brandy and
water and a cigar, as the new acquaintance also was&mdash;no, I
remember, he was fond of gin and water, and did not smoke.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t think he had so much influence over the young
ladies as the other priest, which was, perhaps, owing to his not
being so good-looking; but I am sure he had more influence with
the governor, owing, doubtless, to his bearing him company in
drinking mixed liquors, which the other priest did not do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a strange fellow, that same new acquaintance of
ours, and unlike all the priests I saw in that country, and I saw
plenty of various nations:&mdash;they were always upon their
guard, and had their features and voice modulated; but this man
was subject to fits of absence, during which he would frequently
mutter to himself; then, though he was perfectly civil to
everybody, as far as words went, I observed that he entertained a
thorough contempt for most people, especially for those whom he
was making dupes.&nbsp; I have observed him whilst drinking with
our governor, when the old man&rsquo;s head was turned, look at
him with an air which seemed to say, &lsquo;What a thundering old
fool you are!&rsquo; and at our young ladies, when their backs
were turned, with a glance which <!-- page 420--><a
name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 420</span>said
distinctly enough, &lsquo;You precious pair of
ninny-hammers!&rsquo; and then his laugh&mdash;he had two kinds
of laughs&mdash;one which you could hear, and another which you
could only see.&nbsp; I have seen him laugh at our governor and
the young ladies, when their heads were turned away, but I heard
no sound.&nbsp; My mother had a sandy cat, which sometimes used
to open its mouth wide with a mew which nobody could hear, and
the silent laugh of that red-haired priest used to put me
wonderfully in mind of the silent mew of my mother&rsquo;s
sandy-red cat.&nbsp; And then the other laugh, which you could
hear; what a strange laugh that was, never loud, yes, I have
heard it tolerably loud.&nbsp; He once passed near me, after
having taken leave of a silly English fellow&mdash;a limping
parson of the name of Platitude, who, they said, was thinking of
turning Papist, and was much in his company; I was standing
behind the pillar of a piazza, and as he passed he was laughing
heartily.&nbsp; Oh, he was a strange fellow, that same red-haired
acquaintance of ours!</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we had been at Rome about six weeks, our old
friend the priest of Naples arrived, but without his subordinate,
for whose services he now perhaps thought that he had no
occasion.&nbsp; I believe he found matters in our family wearing
almost as favourable an aspect as he could desire: with what he
had previously taught them and shown them at Naples and
elsewhere, and with what the red-haired confederate had taught
them and shown them at Rome, the poor young ladies had become
quite hand-maids of superstition, so that they, especially the
youngest, were prepared to bow down to anything, and kiss
anything, however vile and ugly, provided a priest commanded
them; and <!-- page 421--><a name="page421"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 421</span>as for the old governor, what with
the influence which his daughters exerted, and what with the
ascendency which the red-haired man had obtained over him, he
dared not say his purse, far less his soul, was his own.&nbsp;
Only think of an Englishman not being master of his own
purse!&nbsp; My acquaintance, the lady&rsquo;s maid, assured me
that, to her certain knowledge, he had disbursed to the
red-haired man, for purposes of charity, as it was said, at least
one thousand pounds during the five weeks we had been at
Rome.&nbsp; She also told me that things would shortly be brought
to a conclusion&mdash;and so indeed they were, though in a
different manner from what she and I and some other people
imagined; that there was to be a grand festival, and a mass, at
which we were to be present, after which the family were to be
presented to the Holy Father, for so those two priestly sharks
had managed it; and then . . . she said she was certain that the
two ladies, and perhaps the old governor, would forsake the
religion of their native land, taking up with that of these
foreign regions, for so my fellow-servant expressed it, and that
perhaps attempts might be made to induce us poor English servants
to take up with the foreign religion, that is herself and me, for
as for our fellow-servant, the other maid, she wanted no
inducing, being disposed body and soul to go over to it.&nbsp;
Whereupon, I swore with an oath that nothing should induce me to
take up with the foreign religion; and the poor maid, my
fellow-servant, bursting into tears, said that for her part she
would sooner die than have anything to do with it; thereupon we
shook hands and agreed to stand by and countenance one another:
and moreover, <!-- page 422--><a name="page422"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 422</span>provided our governors were fools
enough to go over to the religion of these here foreigners, we
would not wait to be asked to do the like, but leave them at
once, and make the best of our way home, even if we were forced
to beg on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last the day of the grand festival came, and we were
all to go to the big church to hear the mass.&nbsp; Now it
happened that for some time past I had been much afflicted with
melancholy, especially when I got up of a morning, produced by
the strange manner in which I saw things going on in our family;
and to dispel it in some degree, I had been in the habit of
taking a dram before breakfast.&nbsp; On the morning in question,
feeling particularly low-spirited when I thought of the foolish
step our governor would probably take before evening, I took two
drams before breakfast; and after breakfast, feeling my
melancholy still continuing, I took another, which produced a
slight effect upon my head, though I am convinced nobody observed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away we drove to the big church; it was a dark, misty
day, I remember, and very cold, so that if anybody had noticed my
being slightly in liquor, I could have excused myself by saying
that I had merely taken a glass to fortify my constitution
against the weather; and of one thing I am certain, which is,
that such an excuse would have stood me in stead with our
governor, who looked, I thought, as if he had taken one too; but
I may be mistaken, and why should I notice him, seeing that he
took no notice of me: so away we drove to the big church, to
which all the population of the place appeared to be moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On arriving there we dismounted, and the <!-- page
423--><a name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
423</span>two priests, who were with us, led the family in,
whilst I followed at a little distance, but quickly lost them
amidst the throng of people.&nbsp; I made my way, however, though
in what direction I knew not, except it was one in which
everybody seemed striving, and by dint of elbowing and pushing I
at last got to a place which looked like the aisle of a
cathedral, where the people stood in two rows, a space between
being kept open by certain strangely-dressed men who moved up and
down with rods in their hands; all were looking to the upper end
of this place or aisle; and at the upper end, separated from the
people by palings like those of an altar, sat in
magnificent-looking stalls, on the right and the left, various
wonderful-looking individuals in scarlet dresses.&nbsp; At the
farther end was what appeared to be an altar, on the left hand
was a pulpit, and on the right a stall higher than any of the
rest, where was a figure whom I could scarcely see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pretend to describe what I saw exactly,
for my head, which was at first rather flurried, had become more
so from the efforts which I had made to get through the crowd;
also from certain singing, which proceeded from I know not where;
and, above all, from the bursts of an organ, which were
occasionally so loud that I thought the roof, which was painted
with wondrous colours, would come toppling down on those
below.&nbsp; So there stood I&mdash;a poor English
servant&mdash;in that outlandish place, in the midst of that
foreign crowd, looking at that outlandish sight, hearing those
outlandish sounds, and occasionally glancing at our party, which,
by this time, I distinguished at the opposite side to where I
stood, but much nearer <!-- page 424--><a
name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 424</span>the place
where the red figures sat.&nbsp; Yes, there stood our poor
governor, and the sweet young ladies, and I thought they never
looked so handsome before; and close by them were the sharking
priests, and not far from them was that idiotical parson
Platitude, winking and grinning, and occasionally lifting up his
hands as if in ecstasy at what he saw and heard, so that he drew
upon himself the notice of the congregation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now an individual mounted the pulpit, and began to
preach in a language which I did not understand, but which I
believe to be Latin, addressing himself seemingly to the figure
in the stall; and when he had ceased, there was more singing,
more organ-playing, and then two men in robes brought forth two
things which they held up; and then the people bowed their heads,
and our poor governor bowed his head, and the sweet young ladies
bowed their heads, and the sharking priests, whilst the idiotical
parson Platitude tried to fling himself down; and then there were
various evolutions withinside the pale, and the scarlet figures
got up and sat down; and this kind of thing continued for some
time.&nbsp; At length the figure which I had seen in the
principal stall came forth and advanced towards the people; an
awful figure he was, a huge old man with a sugar-loaf hat, with a
sulphur-coloured dress, and holding a crook in his hand like that
of a shepherd; and as he advanced the people fell on their knees,
our poor old governor amongst them; the sweet young ladies, the
sharking priests, the idiotical parson Platitude, all fell on
their knees, and somebody or other tried to pull me on my knees;
but by this time I had become outrageous; all that my <!-- page
425--><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
425</span>poor brother used to tell me of the superstitions of
the high Barbary shore rushed into my mind, and I thought they
were acting them over here; above all, the idea that the sweet
young ladies, to say nothing of my poor old governor, were, after
the conclusion of all this mummery, going to deliver themselves
up body and soul into the power of that horrid-looking old man,
maddened me, and, rushing forward into the open space, I
confronted the horrible-looking old figure with the sugar-loaf
hat, the sulphur-coloured garments, and shepherd&rsquo;s crook,
and shaking my fist at his nose, I bellowed out in
English&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for you, old Mumbo Jumbo,
though you have fetish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely tell you what occurred for some
time.&nbsp; I have a dim recollection that hands were laid upon
me, and that I struck out violently left and right.&nbsp; On
coming to myself, I was seated on a stone bench in a large room,
something like a guard-room, in the custody of certain fellows
dressed like Merry Andrews; they were bluff, good-looking,
wholesome fellows, very different from the sallow Italians; they
were looking at me attentively, and occasionally talking to each
other in a language which sounded very like the cracking of
walnuts in the mouth, very different from cooing Italian.&nbsp;
At last one of them asked me in Italian what had ailed me, to
which I replied, in an incoherent manner, something about Mumbo
Jumbo; whereupon the fellow, one of the bluffest of the lot, a
jovial, rosy-faced rascal, lifted up his right hand, placing it
in such a manner that the lips were between the forefinger and
thumb, then lifting up his right foot and drawing back his <!--
page 426--><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
426</span>head, he sucked in his breath with a hissing sound, as
if to imitate one drinking a hearty draught, and then slapped me
on the shoulder, saying something which sounded like goot wine,
goot companion, whereupon they all laughed, exclaiming, ya, ya,
goot companion.&nbsp; And now hurried into the room our poor old
governor, with the red-haired priest.&nbsp; The first asked what
could have induced me to behave in such a manner in such a place,
to which I replied that I was not going to bow down to Mumbo
Jumbo, whatever other people might do.&nbsp; Whereupon my master
said he believed I was mad, and the priest said he believed I was
drunk; to which I answered that I was neither so mad nor drunk
but I could distinguish how the wind lay.&nbsp; Whereupon they
left me, and in a little time I was told by the bluff-looking
Merry Andrews I was at liberty to depart.&nbsp; I believe the
priest, in order to please my governor, interceded for me in high
quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one good resulted from this affair; there was no
presentation of our family to the Holy Father, for old Mumbo was
so frightened by my outrageous looks that he was laid up for a
week, as I was afterwards informed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went home, and had scarcely been there half an hour
when I was sent for by the governor, who again referred to the
scene in church, said that he could not tolerate such scandalous
behaviour, and that unless I promised to be more circumspect in
future he should be compelled to discharge me.&nbsp; I said that
if he was scandalised at my behaviour in the church, I was more
scandalised at all I saw going on in the family, which was
governed by two rascally priests, who, <!-- page 427--><a
name="page427"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 427</span>not content
with plundering him, appeared bent on hurrying the souls of us
all to destruction; and that with respect to discharging me, he
could do so that moment, as I wished to go.&nbsp; I believe his
own reason told him that I was right, for he made no direct
answer, but, after looking on the ground for some time, he told
me to leave him.&nbsp; As he did not tell me to leave the house,
I went to my room, intending to lie down for an hour or two; but
scarcely was I there when the door opened, and in came the
red-haired priest.&nbsp; He showed himself, as he always did,
perfectly civil, asked me how I was, took a chair and sat
down.&nbsp; After a hem or two he entered into a long
conversation on the excellence of what he called the Catholic
religion; told me that he hoped I would not set myself against
the light, and likewise against my interest; for that the family
were about to embrace the Catholic religion, and would make it
worth my while to follow their example.&nbsp; I told him that the
family might do what they pleased, but that I would never forsake
the religion of my country for any consideration whatever; that I
was nothing but a poor servant, but I was not to be bought by
base gold.&nbsp; &lsquo;I admire your honourable feelings,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;you shall have no gold; and as I see you are a
fellow of spirit, and do not like being a servant, for which I
commend you, I can promise you something better.&nbsp; I have a
good deal of influence in this place, and if you will not set
your face against the light, but embrace the Catholic religion, I
will undertake to make your fortune.&nbsp; You remember those
fine fellows to-day who took you into custody? they are the
guards of his Holiness.&nbsp; I have no doubt that <!-- page
428--><a name="page428"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 428</span>I
have interest enough to procure your enrolment amongst
them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;become
swash-buckler to Mumbo Jumbo up here!&nbsp; May
I&mdash;&rsquo;&mdash;and here I swore&mdash;&lsquo;if I
do.&nbsp; The mere possibility of one of their children being
swash-buckler to Mumbo Jumbo on the high Barbary shore has always
been a source of heart-breaking to my poor parents.&nbsp; What,
then, would they not undergo, if they knew for certain that their
other child was swash-buckler to Mumbo Jumbo up
here?&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he asked me, even as you did some
time ago, what I meant by Mumbo Jumbo?&nbsp; And I told him all I
had heard about the Mumbo Jumbo of the high Barbary shore;
telling him that I had no doubt that the old fellow up here was
his brother, or nearly related to him.&nbsp; The man with the red
hair listened with the greatest attention to all I said, and when
I had concluded, he got up, nodded to me, and moved to the door;
ere he reached the door I saw his shoulders shaking, and as he
closed it behind him I heard him distinctly laughing, to the tune
of&mdash;he! he! he!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now matters began to mend.&nbsp; That same evening
my young master unexpectedly arrived.&nbsp; I believe he soon
perceived that something extraordinary had been going on in the
family.&nbsp; He was for some time closeted with the governor,
with whom, I believe, he had a dispute; for my fellow-servant,
the lady&rsquo;s maid, informed me that she heard high words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather late at night the young gentleman sent for me
into his room, and asked me various questions with respect to
what had been going on, and my behaviour in the church, of which
he <!-- page 429--><a name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
429</span>had heard something.&nbsp; I told him all I knew with
respect to the intrigues of the two priests in the family, and
gave him a circumstantial account of all that had occurred in the
church; adding that, under similar circumstances, I was ready to
play the same part over again.&nbsp; Instead of blaming me, he
commended my behaviour, told me I was a fine fellow, and said he
hoped that, if he wanted my assistance, I would stand by him:
this I promised to do.&nbsp; Before I left him, he entreated me
to inform him the very next time I saw the priests entering the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next morning, as I was in the court-yard, where I
had placed myself to watch, I saw the two enter and make their
way up a private stair to the young ladies&rsquo; apartment; they
were attended by a man dressed something like a priest, who bore
a large box; I instantly ran to relate what I had seen to my
young master.&nbsp; I found him shaving.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will just
finish what I am about,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and then wait upon
these gentlemen.&rsquo;&nbsp; He finished what he was about with
great deliberation; then taking a horsewhip, and bidding me
follow him, he proceeded at once to the door of his
sisters&rsquo; apartment: finding it fastened, he burst it open
at once with his foot and entered, followed by myself.&nbsp;
There we beheld the two unfortunate young ladies down on their
knees before a large female doll, dressed up, as usual, in rags
and tinsel; the two priests were standing near, one on either
side, with their hands uplifted, whilst the fellow who brought
the trumpery stood a little way down the private stair, the door
of which stood open; without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, my
young master rushed forward, gave the image a cut or two with his
horsewhip&mdash;then <!-- page 430--><a name="page430"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 430</span>flying at the priests, he gave them
a sound flogging, kicked them down the private stair, and spurned
the man, box and image after them&mdash;then locking the door, he
gave his sisters a fine sermon, in which he represented to them
their folly in worshipping a silly wooden graven image, which,
though it had eyes, could see not; though it had ears, could hear
not; though it had hands, could not help itself; and though it
had feet, could not move about unless it were carried.&nbsp; Oh,
it was a fine sermon that my young master preached, and sorry I
am that the Father of the fetish, old Mumbo, did not hear
it.&nbsp; The elder sister looked ashamed, but the youngest, who
was very weak, did nothing but wring her hands, weep and bewail
the injury which had been done to the dear image.&nbsp; The young
man, however, without paying much regard to either of them, went
to his father, with whom he had a long conversation, which
terminated in the old governor giving orders for preparations to
be made for the family&rsquo;s leaving Rome and returning to
England.&nbsp; I believe that the old governor was glad of his
son&rsquo;s arrival, and rejoiced at the idea of getting away
from Italy, where he had been so plundered and imposed
upon.&nbsp; The priests, however, made another attempt upon the
poor young ladies.&nbsp; By the connivance of the female servant
who was in their interest they found their way once more into
their apartment, bringing with them the fetish image, whose body
they partly stripped, exhibiting upon it certain sanguine marks
which they had daubed upon it with red paint, but which they said
were the result of the lashes which it had received from the
horsewhip.&nbsp; The youngest girl believed all they said, and
kissed and embraced the <!-- page 431--><a
name="page431"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 431</span>dear image;
but the eldest, whose eyes had been opened by her brother, to
whom she was much attached, behaved with proper dignity; for,
going to the door, she called the female servant who had a
respect for me, and in her presence reproached the two deceivers
for their various impudent cheats, and especially for this their
last attempt at imposition; adding, that if they did not
forthwith withdraw and rid her sister and herself of their
presence, she would send word by her maid to her brother, who
would presently take effectual means to expel them.&nbsp; They
took the hint and departed, and we saw no more of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of three days we departed from Rome, but the
maid whom the priests had cajoled remained behind, and it is
probable that the youngest of our ladies would have done the same
thing if she could have had her own will, for she was continually
raving about her image, and saying she should wish to live with
it in a convent; but we watched the poor thing, and got her on
board ship.&nbsp; Oh, glad was I to leave that fetish country and
old Mumbo behind me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nothing but Gloom&mdash;Sporting Character&mdash;Gouty
Tory&mdash;Servants&rsquo; Club&mdash;Politics&mdash;Reformado
Footman&mdash;Peroration&mdash;Good Night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We arrived in England, and went to our country seat,
but the peace and tranquillity of the family had been marred, and
I no longer found my place the pleasant one which it had formerly
been; there was nothing but gloom in the house, for the youngest
daughter exhibited signs of lunacy, and was obliged to be kept
under confinement.&nbsp; The next season I attended my master,
his son, and eldest daughter to London, as I had previously
done.&nbsp; There I left them, for hearing that a young baronet,
an acquaintance of the family, wanted a servant, I applied for
the place, with the consent of my masters, both of whom gave me a
strong recommendation; and, being approved of, I went to live
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My new master was what is called a sporting character,
very fond of the turf, upon which he was not very
fortunate.&nbsp; He was frequently very much in want of money,
and my wages were anything but regularly paid; nevertheless, I
liked him very much, for he treated me more like a friend than a
domestic, continually consulting me as to his affairs.&nbsp; At
length he was brought nearly to his <!-- page 433--><a
name="page433"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 433</span>last
shifts, by backing the favourite at the Derby, which favourite
turned out a regular brute, being found nowhere at the
rush.&nbsp; Whereupon, he and I had a solemn consultation over
fourteen glasses of brandy and water, and as many cigars&mdash;I
mean, between us&mdash;as to what was to be done.&nbsp; He wished
to start a coach, in which event he was to be driver, and I
guard.&nbsp; He was quite competent to drive a coach, being a
first-rate whip, and I dare say I should have made a first-rate
guard; but, to start a coach requires money, and we neither of us
believed that anybody would trust us with vehicles and horses, so
that idea was laid aside.&nbsp; We then debated as to whether or
not he should go into the Church; but to go into the
Church&mdash;at any rate to become a dean or bishop, which would
have been our aim&mdash;it is necessary for a man to possess some
education; and my master, although he had been at the best school
in England, that is, the most expensive, and also at College, was
almost totally illiterate, so we let the Church scheme follow
that of the coach.&nbsp; At last, bethinking me that he was
tolerably glib at the tongue, as most people are who are addicted
to the turf, also a great master of slang; remembering also that
he had a crabbed old uncle who had some borough interest, I
proposed that he should get into the House, promising in one
fortnight to qualify him to make a figure in it, by certain
lessons which I would give him.&nbsp; He consented; and during
the next fortnight I did little else than give him lessons in
elocution, following to a tittle the method of the great
professor, which I had picked up, listening behind the
door.&nbsp; At the end of that period, we paid a <!-- page
434--><a name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
434</span>visit to his relation, an old gouty Tory, who, at
first, received us very coolly.&nbsp; My master, however, by
flattering a predilection of his for Billy Pitt, soon won his
affections so much, that he promised to bring him into
Parliament; and in less than a month was as good as his
word.&nbsp; My master, partly by his own qualifications, and
partly by the assistance which he had derived, and still
occasionally derived from me, cut a wonderful figure in the
House, and was speedily considered one of the most promising
speakers; he was always a good hand at promising&mdash;he is at
present, I believe, a Cabinet Minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as he got up in the world he began to look down on
me.&nbsp; I believe he was ashamed of the obligation under which
he lay to me; and at last, requiring no farther hints as to
oratory from a poor servant like me, he took an opportunity of
quarrelling with me and discharging me.&nbsp; However, as he had
still some grace, he recommended me to a gentleman with whom,
since he had attached himself to politics, he had formed an
acquaintance, the editor of a grand Tory Review.&nbsp; I lost
caste terribly amongst the servants for entering the service of a
person connected with a profession so mean as literature; and it
was proposed at the Servants&rsquo; Club, in Park Lane, to eject
me from that society.&nbsp; The proposition, however, was not
carried into effect, and I was permitted to show myself among
them, though few condescended to take much notice of me.&nbsp; My
master was one of the best men in the world, but also one of the
most sensitive.&nbsp; On his veracity being impugned by the
editor of a newspaper, he called him out, and shot him through
<!-- page 435--><a name="page435"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
435</span>the arm.&nbsp; Though servants are seldom admirers of
their masters, I was a great admirer of mine, and eager to follow
his example.&nbsp; The day after the encounter, on my veracity
being impugned by the servant of Lord C--- in something I said in
praise of my master, I determined to call him out; so I went into
another room and wrote a challenge.&nbsp; But whom should I send
it by?&nbsp; Several servants to whom I applied refused to be the
bearers of it; they said I had lost caste, and they could not
think of going out with me.&nbsp; At length the servant of the
Duke of B--- consented to take it; but he made me to understand
that, though he went out with me, he did so merely because he
despised the Whiggish principles of Lord C---&rsquo;s servant,
and that if I thought he intended to associate with me I should
be mistaken.&nbsp; Politics, I must tell you, at that time ran as
high amongst the servants as the gentlemen, the servants,
however, being almost invariably opposed to the politics of their
respective masters, though both parties agreed in one point, the
scouting of everything low and literary, though I think, of the
two, the liberal or reform party were the most inveterate.&nbsp;
So he took my challenge, which was accepted; we went out, Lord
C---&rsquo;s servant being seconded by a reformado footman from
the palace.&nbsp; We fired three times without effect; but this
affair lost me my place; my master on hearing it forthwith
discharged me; he was, as I have said before, very sensitive, and
he said this duel of mine was a parody of his own.&nbsp; Being,
however, one of the best men in the world, on his discharging me
he made me a donation of twenty pounds.</p>
<p><!-- page 436--><a name="page436"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
436</span>&ldquo;And it was well that he made me this present,
for without it I should have been penniless, having contracted
rather expensive habits during the time that I lived with the
young baronet.&nbsp; I now determined to visit my parents, whom I
had not seen for years.&nbsp; I found them in good health, and,
after staying with them for two months, I returned again in the
direction of town, walking, in order to see the country.&nbsp; On
the second day of my journey, not being used to such fatigue, I
fell ill at an inn on the Great North Road, and there I continued
for some weeks till I recovered, but by that time my money was
entirely spent.&nbsp; By living at the inn I had contracted an
acquaintance with the master and the people, and become
accustomed to inn life.&nbsp; As I thought that I might find some
difficulty in procuring any desirable situation in London, owing
to my late connection with literature, I determined to remain
where I was, provided my services would be accepted.&nbsp; I
offered them to the master, who, finding I knew something of
horses, engaged me as a postillion.&nbsp; I have remained there
since.&nbsp; You have now heard my story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay, you shan&rsquo;t say that I told my tale without
a per&mdash;peroration.&nbsp; What shall it be?&nbsp; Oh, I
remember something which will serve for one!&nbsp; As I was
driving my chaise some weeks ago; I saw standing at the gate of
an avenue, which led up to an old mansion, a figure which I
thought I recognised.&nbsp; I looked at it attentively, and the
figure, as I passed, looked at me; whether it remembered me I do
not know, but I recognised the face it showed me full well.</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
